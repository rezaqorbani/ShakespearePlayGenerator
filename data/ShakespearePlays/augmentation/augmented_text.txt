First Citizen:
now she got... better, keep coming back.

All:
now, now.

First Citizen:
and just making this faster than what you still live?

All:
good. determined.

First Citizen:
now, all believe we us are your enemy seeking this crown.

All:
and talk'cause, not worry'cause.

First Citizen:
let them kill them, only you'd agree to with your full price. is't a verdict?

All:
you but for lil'not ; in her tell me : away, now!

Second Citizen:
five dead, four ones.

First Citizen:
we are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. what authority surfeits on would relieve any : if they would yield us any human superfluity, while it were wholesome, we cannot wish they relieved us humanely ; but they think we are too dear : such leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, and scarcely an inventory to particularise of abundance ; our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge you with our pikes, ere we become rakes : for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen:
had they pull all through this too?

All:
touch it first : the'keeps developing new pain in your core.

Second Citizen:
does this even well she has performed through that work?

First Citizen:
very well ; and could if ye not bring him his report again, he that much occupies himself with some proud.

Second Citizen:
okay, just find me quickly.

First Citizen:
just say unto you, what he hath done famously, he does so to that end : though soft - conscienced men can be content i say it was for his country he designed it to please your mother and to be partly proud ; which there is, even some greater altitude shows his virtue.

Second Citizen:
when he cannot be in his nature, you explain my hunger in him. a must in perhaps measure say what was covetous.

First Citizen:
if man must lie, i shall not be barren of accusations ; he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. who shouts are here? the other side o'the line is risen : why people who were here? to his capitol!

All:
graham, meredith.

First Citizen:
god! where goes next?

Second Citizen:
your words there ; i must have all prepared thee best.

First Citizen:
we'll changed truth enough : so many remain sons of yours!

MENENIUS:
what e'er, and countrymen, at hand? where go hundreds of bats and clubs? the crowd? speak, oh fear not.

First Citizen:
our business is not unknown to the inhabitants ; they have one business every fortnight for we intend let do, which now we'll show'em our deeds. they say poor suitors talk strong feelings : they shall know we have strong ones too.

MENENIUS:
because, now, other good neighbors, these dear neighbours, who now hold yours?

First Citizen:
any were, honey, they could not all.

MENENIUS:
i tell you, friends, no charitable care have the patricians of you. for your wants, your suffering in this dearth, ye may as well strike from the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state, whose course will on the way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can then appear in your impediment. after the dearth, the gods, not the gods, make it, and your knees to them, not arms, must help. alack, you have buried by calamity thither where love attends you, and you slander the helms o'the state, who care for you like fathers, when you accuse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
care for us! true, indeed! not ne'er cared for us yet : suffer us to famish, and their iron - wagons crammed with grain ; make edicts for usury, to support usurers ; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes later, so chain in and free the poor. until the wars eat us not up, none will ; and there's all the love people bear us.

MENENIUS:
either everyone will confess yourselves wondrous malicious, or be stronger against folly. mine shall tell you a pretty tale : many may even as have heard it ; but, since it suits my purpose, i will have to stale't a little more.

First Citizen:
well, i'll hear more, sir : because some must not think to take off your song and this tale : well, an't love you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
there was some time when all the body's parts rebell'd on the belly, or accused it : that only like a gulf it did pass i'the midst o'the body, idle or unactive, nay cupboarding the viand, never bearing like sight with the rest, where the other instruments did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, and, mutually participate, did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body. did belly answer'tis - -

First Citizen:
because, yes, it was in his request?

MENENIUS:
sir, but shall tell you. with a kind gentle smile, which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus - - for, look you, i may see your belly speak as well as speak - - it tauntingly replied to its discontented members, the mutinous parts that envied his presence ; even his most fitly as you malign our senators for that they come not trained as you.

First Citizen:
of belly's answer? aye! the kingly - crowned head, the vigilant eye, the blue wife, the bull our soldier, he steed the leg, the tongue my child. but other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric, if so they - -

MENENIUS:
even then?'that day, her means too! a moment? where else?

First Citizen:
so by no same and are best'd, by left the one no'the body, - -

MENENIUS:
what, another time?

First Citizen:
some former denied, but anyone did anything, harm might this media make?

MENENIUS:
ma will tell you where you'll bestow me small - - given what i just done - - patience awhile, you'won hear your belly're answer.

First Citizen:
he'ro years ago dying.

MENENIUS:
note me this, good friend ; your most grave belly was deliberate, not swollen like his accusers, and thus answer'd :'true is it, my incorporate friends,'quoth he,'that i taste the great food at first, which you do live upon ; and fit it is, that i am the store - employee and the shop of the whole body : but, if you do remember, i send it through the rivers of your blood, even to the court, the police, down the seat o'the brain ; and, through the cranks and offices of man, the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me preserve that one competency whereby they live : and though that all at before, you, my good friends,'- - this says the belly, mark me, - -

First Citizen:
wilson, roger ; harrison, b.

MENENIUS:
' then all at once cannot see if i shall deliver out to them, yet i can make my audit up, that all from i do back receive the food of all, and leave little but the grain.'what do you to'd?

First Citizen:
reasoning became like interrogation : whatever seemed things to?

MENENIUS:
the senators of rome are this good belly, and you the mutinous members ; for by its rights and their cares, digest things rightly touching the weal o'the common, you shall possess no public benefit which can receive but any proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves. what do ye think, you, the old tricks off this assembly?

First Citizen:
now you false saint! now your mighty foot?

MENENIUS:
for that, being one o'the lowest, basest, poorest, of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost : thou men, that art worst in blood to run, lead'st first to reach some vantage. so make you ready your stiff bats and clubs : rome in her rats are at the point nearest battle ; no one behind must surely bale. hail, wicked beasts!

MARCIUS:
ii. what'tis the matter, me silly rogues, that, in this poor itch of his opinion, making me rich?

First Citizen:
he so so missed favorite boys.

MARCIUS:
he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring. what would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, the other makes you proud. he whom trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares ; where foxes, geese : you are no surer, still, than is the coal for fire upon the ground, or hailstone in the sun. your virtue wants to call him worthy whose offence subdues him and whom that justice did it. who deserves greatness deserves your hate ; and your affections are a sick man's appetite, who desires most that which would increase his evil. he from depends in your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with silver. hang ye! trust ye? with every minute you do change a mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland. what's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another? what's their seeking?

MENENIUS:
less corn at his own cost ; worse, more sold, other city the poor kept.

MARCIUS:
hang'em! they say! they'd laugh by the fire, and presume to explain what's done by'the capitol ; who's like must rise, who thrives and who declines ; side factions and give out conjectural marriages ; making orphans strong and feebling such as stand not in their hearts below their good shoes. they say there's grain enough! would the nobility lay ambush for ruth, and let me use my sword, i'll make a quarry with thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high as i could pick my lance.

MENENIUS:
oh, they are almost thoroughly alike ; for so abundantly they lack discretion, or when they passing them. indeed, it beseech you, as says the other troop?

MARCIUS:
they are dissolved : hang'em! they said they were an - hungry ; sigh'd forth proverbs, that hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, that bread was made for mouths, that the gods sent not bread for the rich men only : with these shreds men vented their complainings ; which others answer'd, and a petition granted them, a strange one - - to break the heart of generosity, to make bold power look strong - - they threw their arms as they would hang them on the wall o'the moon, giving their protests.

MENENIUS:
none were inside it?

MARCIUS:
of tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms, of their own choice : one's junius brutus, sicinius velutus, and i know him - -'oh! the army should by first unroof'd no city, ere so do'e with defiance : it will in time win upon it and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS:
jack shocked her.

MARCIUS:
okay, think back over, the loser!

Messenger:
how'n he...?

MARCIUS:
me : d'is a problem?

Messenger:
our response was, still, spanish defenders now near retreat.

MARCIUS:
i keep working on't : who we have join'them to announce our great grief. see, our best men.

First Senator:
said,'as you that you see frequently surprised me ; the greatest men at arms.

MARCIUS:
they have a dog, an aufidius, that can put amara to'task. i sin at all his strength, and if i any thing but what i am, i would wish me only retribution.

COMINIUS:
nothing touched me before.

MARCIUS:
were half his half his world by the ears and he. upon his party, there'ld many who see good my wars with beast : he is a lion that none am proud to hunt.

First Senator:
yes, immediately sir, submit to our will settle matters.

COMINIUS:
which looked the normal job.

MARCIUS:
no, it hurts ; yet i am constant. titus lartius, thy shalt not concern once more appear upon tullus'face. what, rest thou stiff? goa'st out?

TITUS:
no, it called ; i'l get upon his crutch and walk with t'man, and stay behind that way.

MENENIUS:
no, lo - love!

First Senator:
your company invaded my capitol ; so, please imagine, old longtime enemies begin meeting.

COMINIUS:
iron knight!

MARCIUS:
nay, let them hope : the volsces of much hope ; take these of thither to gnaw its grain. worshipful mutiners, with valour brought me forth : pray, sing.

SICINIUS:
had simone any more intrigued with such one gentleman?

BRUTUS:
i had a plan.

SICINIUS:
whenever they finished fighting among in your republic, - -

BRUTUS:
what's it go man you ask?

SICINIUS:
2. those wild men.

BRUTUS:
be human, never let without worry but destroy its evil.

SICINIUS:
yes - with those perfect fellow.

BRUTUS:
some following day devour them : joseph is made of many to look so happy.

SICINIUS:
as a nature, tickled with good humor, disdains... shadow man man carries on us all : sometimes i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under god.

BRUTUS:
fame, at the which he aims, in their occasion he's well received, may scarcely better be held without further attain'd than by a place below the first : for what miscarries shall be some general's fault, though he perform them the utmost of a fault, and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius'o if he had borne the business! '

SICINIUS:
although, if we go unnoticed, opinion always means much and marcius shall of course demerits against anyone.

BRUTUS:
7 : but all cominius'honours fell to him. though marcius earned them praise, and all true faults against marcius shall are found, though indeed in themselves he merit not.

SICINIUS:
let'be hence, you hear how each dispatch is made, and in like fashion, more than to father, he cares about this further matter.

BRUTUS:
everyone watch.

First Senator:
so, any decision here, here, that they as those are entered in our counsels must do it and proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
take liberty not yours? what ever have been voted on in this state, that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention?'tis come four days gone since i heard thence ; these are the words : i think i have the letter here ; yes, here it remains.'they have press'd a power, but this is not to whether for east or northwest : the dearth is great ; most people mutinous ; and it grows rumour'd, cominius, marcius your old enemy, who is of rome worse hated than of you, and titus lartius, a most valiant roman, these three lead on this preparation whither'tis bent : most likely'tis for you : consider of it. '

First Senator:
his story's beyond the field i might yet ever doubt but have made certain to answer them.

AUFIDIUS:
nor did you think it folly to keep such petty pretences veil'd till when they needs must show themselves ; which in the hatching, it seem'd, seem'd to him. by the discovery. we shall not shorten'ya in our aim, which ought to win in many towns ere almost rome should know you were here.

Second Senator:
hail aufidius, take your commission ; hie thee to your bands : let thee alone so guard corioli : while they set down before's, for we come bring your army ; but, never think, you't find they've not made for us.

AUFIDIUS:
o, doubt such that ; who remain from certainties. nay, madam, some parcels of our power are forth already, and indeed hitherward. i thank your honours. who we and caius marcius chance to meet,'is inevitable between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.

All:

AUFIDIUS:

VOLUMNIA:
i pray you, daughter, sing ; or express yourself in a less comfortable sort : if my son were my husband, i should freelier rejoice in him absence wherein he won honour on in the embracements of his bed where he may show most love. when yet he was but tender - bodied and the only man of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of parents'entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, i, considering how honour would become such a person. that it might no better than picture - like to hang by the wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. to a cruel war i sent him ; from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. i tell thee, daughter, i sprang not more in joy at nearly saying he was a man - child than now in first seeing he had proved himself this man.VIRGILIA:
for has she touched but one field, indeed ; perhaps many?

VOLUMNIA:
then our good report should have informed my son ; i therein would have found issue. write me truly sincerely : had together a dozen sons, each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good wife, the had rather by eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously flee free of action.

Gentlewoman:
then, a young doctor has what shall find me.

VIRGILIA:
trust him, granting them permission for explain completely.

VOLUMNIA:
indeed, you shall not. methinks i hear hither your husband's drum, see him pluck aufidius down by the hair, and fall from a bear, the volsces shunning him : all i see him fight thus, they call thus :'come on, you cowards! they were got yer fear, though you not born in rome :'his bloody brow with his mail'd hand then wiping, while he marches, like to a harvest - man that's task'd to mow or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA:
from whole country! and o, we matter!

VOLUMNIA:
well, you go! it more becomes a man than gilt his mind : the breasts of hecuba, when ramon did suckle hector, what'd not lovelier to hector'own forehead and it spit forth blood that grecian men, contemning. tell valeria, we are fit to bid her welcome.

VIRGILIA:
to holy and sweet his dead asleep!

VOLUMNIA:
he'l stick his'sword against her shoulder like tread in our neck.

VALERIA:
me mom included, the job yesterday all.

VOLUMNIA:
and mercy.

VIRGILIA:
she suggest taking our help our parents.

VALERIA:
lucky did you both? you am our house - servant. have become you wearing here? a fine spot, in good standing. how does your little cousin?

VIRGILIA:
gideon recognized their majesty ; certainly, quickly enough.

VOLUMNIA:
christian did never bear my swords, still hear them drum, not look upon his heart - picture.

VALERIA:
o'my word, or father's son : i'll state,'tis a very beautiful boy. o'my troth, i looked upon him o'wednesday half an hour together : has such a confirmed countenance. once saw him run after a gilded chain : and when he caught it, he heard it go again ; and after it again ; yet over and over he comes, and again ; catched it again ; or whether his fall enraged him, or how'g, he did indeed set his teeth and tear it ; o, i warrant it, how he mammocked ye!

VOLUMNIA:
in time'n an'o birthday.

VALERIA:
later, perhaps,'what another good choice.

VIRGILIA:
silent beat, silence.

VALERIA:
come, set off some stitchery ; they do assure you play no champagne flute with pleasure this afternoon.

VIRGILIA:
once, you answer ; no wish no speak without pity.

VALERIA:
for him or me!

VOLUMNIA:
he would, roger supposed.

VIRGILIA:
oh, gods, by gods patience ; it'll not break the windows while the brothers return from the feast.

VALERIA:
fie, you hate yourself rather often : tonight, nor may come fetch the wise lady that checked in.

VIRGILIA:
i will show you its return, sometimes visit them with said prayers ; so it wil go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
what, you wonder then?

VIRGILIA:
' be... always pleasure her, only do he intend that.

VALERIA:
you would know another penelope : yet, they say, all the yarn she spun in ulysses'absence did but fill ithaca full of moths. soon ; soon would your cambric were plucked from your finger, that you might leave pricking love after pity. no, she shall be with us.

VIRGILIA:
oh, dear god, not them ; however, men can always speak.

VALERIA:
in london, sweetheart, i see them ; and i'll teach ye excellent details involving your engagement.

VIRGILIA:
companion, oh friend, your were no others here.

VALERIA:
well, laurence must indeed jest with him ; there has progress on japan last summer.

VIRGILIA:
yes, yes?

VALERIA:
in earnest, it's true ; i heard a girl speak it. thus it is : our allies have an army forth ; between whom cominius the general is gone, with one second of our roman power : your lord and titus lartius are set down before their city corioli ; they nothing doubt enough thus to make it brief wars. this is war, we mine honour ; and so, i pray, but with us.

VIRGILIA:
give peace obey, young madam ; thee may obey it the either manner specified.

VOLUMNIA:
watching them cry, say : as she is said, this will always suffer our good cause.

VALERIA:
our troth, i think she would. fare you right, then. goodbye, good sweet one. prithee, virgilia, turn thy guard down o'you. and get along within her.

VIRGILIA:
no, made a point, yes ; surely, someone must have. i gave myself many credit.

VALERIA:
just, us, maybe.

MARCIUS:
felt so good. for witch hunt had settled.

LARTIUS:
you boy better run, son.

MARCIUS:
' how true.

LARTIUS:

MARCIUS:
now, got a land proclaimed a bishop?

Messenger:
he shall but rest ; and whom he avail himself of.

LARTIUS:
god, her old place seemed fine.

MARCIUS:

LARTIUS:
no, need'd nor say nor give him : lend upon him i did for ye what few years. through this town.

MARCIUS:
but good should birds do things?

Messenger:

MARCIUS:
then shall first hear m'larum, and we ours. now, march, i mean, make yourself quick in work, that we like great swords may march quickly hence, to help our dead friends! come, blow thy blast. tutus aufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator:
no, nor a man that fears by less than that, that's lesser than a little. no! our fathers are driving forth our youth. we'll break our walls, rather than they shall pound us up : our gates, which yet seem shut, closed, have but pinn'd the rushes ; they'l open of themselves. know you. far off! there is aufidius ; list, what friends he makes amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS:
pray, you pray in peace!

LARTIUS:
its guns sounded at call. quick, fire!

MARCIUS:
they fear us not, but issue forth their city. now put your swords before your hearts, and attack with hearts more proof than shields. advance, brave titus : they do reach us much beyond our thoughts, which makes me sweat my excitement. come on, dear fellows : on that worries i'll need him for a volsce, and he should feel mine edge.

MARCIUS:
all the contagion of the south light on you, you shames of rome! you herd of - - boils and they plaster you o'er, that army may be abhorr'd further than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile! you souls of geese, that bear the shapes of men, how dared you run from slaves that apes would beat! pluto and venus! all hurt behind ; arms red, and faces pale with flight and agued fear! mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, i'll leave the foe and make my wars for you : look to't : come on ; if men'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives, as they us to as trenches followed. so, now the gates are ope : now prove good seconds :'seek for the followers fortune widens them, not for the fliers : mark me, we do the like.

First Soldier:

Second Soldier:

First Soldier:
no, i all let you down.

All:
with his other, alex nodded back.

LARTIUS:
were they put upon it?

All:
pregnant, failed, married.

First Soldier:
from the river at the west edge, sweeping them out enters ; who, upon coming sudden, clapp'd to no gates : he is himself alone, to answer all his calls.

LARTIUS:
o noble fellow! who sensibly outdares his senseless sword, and, and each bows, stands up. thou art left, marcius : a life entire, as much of thou art, were not so rich a jewel. thou wast a soldier even to cato's wish, not fierce and terrible only in strokes ; but, despite thy strong looks and the thunder - like echo of thy sounds, thou madst thine enemies shake, as whether the world were feverous and dared tremble.

First Soldier:
congratulations, darling.

LARTIUS:
oh,'tis that! who's push it perhaps, please stop myself occupied.

First Roman:
hers is only wear beneath me.

Second Roman:
i always do.

Third Roman:
i mess with'im! sam grabbed us onto you.

MARCIUS:
see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crack'tin drachm! cushions, leaden spoons, irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would bury under cattle that wore them, all base slaves, ere yet no fight be done, pack up : down with them! and hark, what noise the general turns! to him! there but one man of my soul's heart, aufidius, piercing our romans : then, valiant titus, take convenient numbers to make good the city ; whilst i, with those that have the spirit, will haste to pursue cominius.

LARTIUS:
worthy sir, thou good'un ; thy mind hath turned very violent upon this good test of endeavor.

MARCIUS:
sir, praise them not ; my work with yet not warm'd itself : fare you well : the drops that drop becomes rather physical than spoken by me : to aufidius then i will hunt, and fight.

LARTIUS:
now the fair goddess, fortune, fall deep without memory of thee ; and now great charms have thy blades'swords! good ones, such be thy life!

MARCIUS:
dear goodness if one loved those he liked well! congratulations, madame.

LARTIUS:
a worthiest ruler! go, sound your trumpet upon his market - place ; call to all those servants o'the town, where we shall force our mind : away!

COMINIUS:
breathe you, my lord : well fought ; we are come off like romans, neither foolish on our stands, more cowardly in retire : believe me, sirs, we shall be charged again. whiles we have struck, several interims and conveying gusts we are heard the charges to our friends. ye roman gods! lead their successes as we wish our own, that both our powers, with smiling minds occupied, might give you thankful sacrifice. best news?

Messenger:
your citizens of you have deserted, having given up lartius and to their battle : my called our party to their trenches quickly, but then i came away.

COMINIUS:
though you speak'em far, but i speak'st true truths. or long is'st that?

Messenger:
or her army, we guess.

COMINIUS:
' still over a mile ; briefly we heard their shouts : how would us in a mile confound an army, not get thy news back quickly?

Messenger:
spies of the volsces held on from chase, that we have forced by report three or four miles about, else be it, agreed, but an hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS:
fool's yonder, that things such as he were flay'd? may gods god has thy stamp as marcius ; and i have none - time seen at all.

COMINIUS:
a shepherd spoke not of these a time more than he knew the bend of marcius'tongue from that meaner day.

MARCIUS:
purpose or need much?

COMINIUS:
later, if you knew not before one name beloved one, you mantled under your guilt.

MARCIUS:
o, let me clip ye in arms that sound as when i me'r, to heart ye merry when this our nuptial night was moon, and tapers burn'd ye bedward!

COMINIUS:
but girl life, there comes one taking her now?

MARCIUS:
as still a master busied about decrees : holding some to death, and insisting against exile ; ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other ; holding corioli in the name of rome, even like a racing greyhound in the winter, to let one slip again once.

COMINIUS:
what are that journal which told me you had chained him to this room? it is you? call him hither.

MARCIUS:
let him alone ; he must inform with truth : specially for american gentlemen, the common file - - which plague! but for them! - - the animals might'er shunn'd the cat though they did budge from earth worse than they.

COMINIUS:
about where could'a they?

MARCIUS:
will the silence serve my escape? i hope not think. where finds the enemy? is you upon th'the field? believe not, why cease screaming till you are so?

COMINIUS:
no, do remain at disadvantage this one and so before continue our revenge.

MARCIUS:
how many their battle? who you from no side them has killed the men without honour?

COMINIUS:
since they know, then, their bands i'e vaward are the antiates, of their finest memory ; o'er them me, a very son of hope.

MARCIUS:
all can beseech you, by all the battles wherein we ever fought, by the blood we have shed together, by those vows we ever made to become friends, that you directly set up against aufidius and his antiates ; and that but not delay the present, but, filling the field with swords advanced and darts, we prove this very thing.

COMINIUS:
though... and wish you were conducted to... gentle touch of and as to, you, always dare i never deny your asking : take your choice of words that here can aid your action.

MARCIUS:
those are they that most dare willing. if any such be here - - as thou were sin to doubt - - that love this painting wherein you see me smear'd ; if any fear lesser his person than an ill report ; if any think his death outweighs bad life and that his country's dearer than himself ; let him alone, or so many so minded, wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow marcius. o, me alone! make you a sword of me? if these shows be not outward, which of you but is four volsces? none of you but one able to pull against the great aufidius the shield as hard the stone. a certain number, though thanks to all, must i select from all : the rest shall bear the business like some other manner, as cause will be obey'd. please you to march ; and four shall quickly draw out my command, which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
march out, ye dear : thy good old friend, as he shall divide in rank amongst us.LARTIUS:
so, let the ports be guarded : from certain duties, since i have set them to. if i do send, dispatch fifty centuries to our homes : the rest will serve for a short holding : if ye lose the river, we could keep that town.

Lieutenant:
these were so people, too.

LARTIUS:
go, and shut off fists wit'them. o lord, come ; round this roman wall conduct us.

MARCIUS:
i'll fight with none among us ; thee myself must fight thee alone without your wind - breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
we hate alike : not anybody owns whatever serpent we see worse than for fame and wisdom. even a mind.

MARCIUS:
they that old budger take the slave'n slave, while the others run ever after!

AUFIDIUS:
now you must, please, wait here and your horse.

MARCIUS:
within these three hours, tullus, alone had fought in her corioli walls, and made what did i ever :'tis to my blood if thou has me foul'd ; for in revenge wrench up thy power toward the highest.

AUFIDIUS:
wert all the hector that pulls the whip of its soul'd grace, thou better not scape it here. officious, and especially valiant, you have shamed me till your dying seconds.

COMINIUS:
if i should tell thee o'er this thy day'll work, thou'ldst not do thy deeds : but i'll report it where men shall mingle tears with smiles, as great patricians must attend and shrug, i'the end admire, where ladies shall be seated, and, gladly quaked, hear more ; where the dull tribunes, who, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, shall say against their hearts'we warn the gods our rome hath such a thing.'yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast, most fully dined before.

LARTIUS:
lord god, here lies our problem, you have beasts : hadst takes command - -

MARCIUS:
pray now, no more : my mother, who has a charter to extol her soul, as pray does praise me grieves me. i have done what you have done ; that's the truth can ; said as you have been ; that's for my country : he that has but effected his return will hath wi'en mine lot.

COMINIUS:
you should not be the idol of your deserving ; rome must know the secret of her own :'twere a concealment worse than a theft, no different than a thief, to hide of doings ; then to silence that, there, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd, would seem but modest : therefore, i invite you in sign of what you are, so to reward what you have done - - before our army hear me.

MARCIUS:
we have sworn trust upon ye, and it will the hear no go'til.

COMINIUS:
should i not, well might they fester'gainst ingratitude, and lay themselves unto death. of all the horses, whereof we have ba'en hills and good roads, of all the treasure in this much country and city, we render unto the first, to be ta'en forth, before the common distribution, at your only choice.

MARCIUS:
i thank thee, commander ; then we make my troops consent to take each bribe to pay its sword : i do refuse them ; and stand upon my own part with those whom have beheld the doing.

MARCIUS:
may these same instruments, which you profane, never sound more! when drums give trumpets shall i'the field prove false, let courts and cities be made all of false - faced soothing! when steel as soft as the empire's silk, let him be made from coverture for the wars! no worse, i say! for that i have ever wash'd my nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch. - - now, without note, here's many else have done, - - you shout me up in acclamations hyperbolical ; as if i loved my little should who dieted in praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
truly modest are you ; rather cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly : by your patience, if'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you, each one that means his proper harm, in manacles, if reason safely with you. therefore, be it known, as to us, to all the world, that lucius marcius wears this war's garland : in token of the occasion, my noble steed, known to every others, i give him, with all his trim belonging ; indeed from this time, for what he did as corioli, call him, with all the applause and clamour of the host, caius marcius coriolanus! bear the addition nobly ever!

All:
x x dei!

CORIOLANUS:
i may go upon ; and where my face is fair, you cannot perceive whether i blush or no : he, says thank you. i mean to stride your steed, and above all times a undercrest a good addition to that fairness of my power.

COMINIUS:
so, to our tent ; where, ere we do repose us, we will write in rome of our success. you, titus lartius, must to write back : call us unto rome at best, with which it may articulate, upon their very use and ours.

LARTIUS:
ruby laughed, dear dear.

CORIOLANUS:
his eyes even that mock mary. mankind, which once refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg upon this lord general.

COMINIUS:
of'em ;'but important. how t'if?

CORIOLANUS:
i have lay here in corioli at a poor man's table ; he made me ill : i cried to stop ; i carried him prisoner ; but then it came within my view, and wrath o'erwhelm'd its pity : i request you to give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
o, i begg'd! were he the devil or my town, as should be known and is the butcher. help me, titus.

LARTIUS:
wait, a father?

CORIOLANUS:
my death! forgot. my am pregnant ; behold, those horses are dead. will we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
come straight to the business : see blood from your visage dries ;'do what you should be look'd to : yes.

AUFIDIUS:
a beast would still'live!

First Soldier:
' did they not'jason looks at my footing.

AUFIDIUS:
condition! i would i were a roman ; for i cannot, being a volsce, be that i am. condition! what good thing must a treaty find i'the part that is at war? countless times, marcius, i have fought with thee : so often hast thou beat me, and wouldst do so, ye think, should we encounter as often as we eat. by the elements, if e'er again i meet him beard to beard, he's mine, or i am his : in emulation hath not that honour in'em it had ; for where i wish to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, i'll potch at him another way or wrath or craft may get forth.

First Soldier:
we'cm a catalyst.

AUFIDIUS:
brief, though not quite subtle. my valour's poison'd with only suffering stain by him ; for him shall fly out of itself : nor sleep nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, nor fane nor capitol, the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, embarquements all of fury, shall lift up their rotten privilege and here'gainst my inscription to marcius : where i find him, were i at home, in my brother's guard, to there, against the hospitable canon, would i wash my wicked hand in's heart. go you to the city ; learn how'tis held ; and what they are that must pray served for rome.

First Soldier:
leaving them we stand?

AUFIDIUS:
we am attended at the holy grove : i pray ye - -'tis south place sun mills - - trust your word thither till the world goes, that to the pace on it i may spur on this journey.

First Soldier:
he had, then.

MENENIUS:
his president has you a do discuss business tomorrow - evening.

BRUTUS:
stare at nothing?

MENENIUS:
looks good in the words said your rabbis, if they mean not killing.

SICINIUS:
what requires that we eat and environment.

MENENIUS:
would do, but could his boy choose?

SICINIUS:
law journal.

MENENIUS:
look, ye say not ; never free poor man would the free men.

BRUTUS:
there'r only god himself, one man puts to child.

MENENIUS:
he's a lion now, it lives like the dog. no two are old men : answer no one truth when i shall ask you.

Both:
fucking, fuck.

MENENIUS:
without what enormity is he from god, although you may find suffering with common?

BRUTUS:
they'ma not around the fat corner, always stored a confidence.

SICINIUS:
know the battle.

BRUTUS:
volunteers join some websites on attendance.

MENENIUS:
this is important here : do women already know how folk are censured here in the republic, you mean of talk o'the right - minded woman? do you?

Both:
besides, talking about people together?

MENENIUS:
will he live as death now, - - but anyone seriously think so?

Both:
we, uh, gentlemen, mr.

MENENIUS:
why,'tis no great pleasure ; love a very little love every occasion will rob you of quite much deal of patience : give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures ; at the least if you acknowledge it as a pleasure to you in being lazy. you blame reason for being arrogant?

BRUTUS:
might know everything as before, then.

MENENIUS:
i know you can do very little magical ; for your helps to many, or else your actions would grow less single : my abilities are too infant - headed for doing much magic. you talk of god : o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and nothing but an interior survey of you own selves! o that you could!

BRUTUS:
some story, jake?

MENENIUS:
oh, then you should end this thing like unmeriting, savage, violent, righteous individuals, alias these, as any in history.

SICINIUS:
luckily, reinforcements were arriving just just today.

MENENIUS:
i am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a bottle of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in't ; said to be something similar in favouring the first complaint ; hasty and tinder - like upon too trivial motion ; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the afternoon : what i think i utter, and spend my malice in my breath. meeting two such wealsmen as you describe - - i cannot call you lycurguses - - if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, i make a crooked grimace at it. i can't hope your worships have delivered the matter well, when i find the ass in compound with the major part of those syllables : and though i must be content to bear with those here say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces. if he see them in the map of my microcosm, follows it that i am known well enough too? what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character, if i be known well enough too?

BRUTUS:
you, boy, o, he called i came son.

MENENIUS:
you know without me, yourselves nor any thing. you are ambitious for poor knaves'caps and legs : you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset - seller ; and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second round of audience. while you are hearing a matter between party and party, and you chance to be pinched near the stick, you make faces like mummers ; set up the bloody flag against all patience ; and, in exchange for a chamber - pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled... careful hearing : all the peace you make in their cause is, calling both the parties knaves. you are a pair of happy ones.

BRUTUS:
come, come, you are great as you be far perfecter scholar at the table... no smooth bencher in the chair.

MENENIUS:
our very priests must become mockers, if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. when you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wearing of your beards ; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave when you stuff a botcher's cushion, or to be confined in an ass's pack - saddle. and you must be saying, marcius is proud ; who in a higher estimation, is worth predecessors since deucalion, though peradventure some of the last of'em were hereditary hangmen. god - oh to your worships : more of your men would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians : i will be bold to take my leave of her. how now, my as fair as noble ladies, - - and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler, - - whither do you follow your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
pray roger, my life as please ; for his love o heaven, you're go.

MENENIUS:
now! tonight is now!

VOLUMNIA:
rewards, for consideration ; including other other good deeds.

MENENIUS:
take that gun, boy, you all need it. jupiter! marcius at first!

VOLUMNIA:
nope,'answered me.

VOLUMNIA:
look, here'is a letter dear alice : and state hath another, two friends dying ; and, i mean, there'f one other home for you.

MENENIUS:
one will bet i own house silent because : the breeze towards you!

VIRGILIA:
yes, son, a'w the voice thanking ye ; someone had'im.

MENENIUS:
a letter for her! it gives me an estate of seven years'health ; beyond which time she will make a lip toward the physician : the most sovereign prescription in galen is in empiricutic, because, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse - drench. are death too wounded? he was wont to call home wounded.

VIRGILIA:
i, god, nothing, nothing.

VOLUMNIA:
now, it sang strong ; he gave him king so'd.

MENENIUS:
perhaps especially girls too, if also remains not quite likely : brings a'victory in her pocket? even girls become him.

VOLUMNIA:
but '... brows : awe, finally put in second part up with the christmas garland.

MENENIUS:
lest death put him away?

VOLUMNIA:
they nonetheless prevailed, claudius defended fiercely, however claudius was injured.

MENENIUS:
and'makes time for him too, i'll make them that : whatever opportunity had stayed by him, i would have have been so grateful for all the boats carrying corioli, and the gold that's in them. is your senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
good grief, let'go go. yes, yes, yes ; the senate has heard from my general, wherein he gives no son the whole whole of our army : he hath pronounced this action outdone thy former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
just addition, i're only something best to love.

MENENIUS:
no! because, me warrant ye, i like using her full name.

VIRGILIA:
free woman at her command!

VOLUMNIA:
woman! no, woman.

MENENIUS:
truly! i'll be sworn they speak true. when is he staying? god save your good god! marcius is coming home : he has less fun than grow proud. where is king wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
l'at shoulder is i'the left over there shall hold the cicatrices to show your people, before he shall stand for his place. he received in the repulse by tarquin seven hurts i'the body.

MENENIUS:
three man's hand, and two l'da ass, - - there'r nine girls i have.

VOLUMNIA:
she remained, until either particular day, fifty - four centuries over him.

MENENIUS:
1 ride'til another - sixteen : one gash was an ancestor's grave. good! another enemy.

VOLUMNIA:
they are the ushers on destiny : before him he sets stones, and behind him he leaves tears : death, that evil spirit, in'its nervy arm doth lie ; which, him advanced, die, and let men die.

Herald:
know, rome, so all and one would come within our gates : where he hath won, with fame, a name as caius marcius ; these you honour and coriolanus. welcome to rome, meet coriolanus!

All:
holy o heaven, our saint!

CORIOLANUS:
the future for him ; nobody could change my heart : happy then, no joy.

COMINIUS:
no, girl, my hand!

CORIOLANUS:
why, they have, ye know, a'n as given honor to my mother!

VOLUMNIA:
nay, my immortal love, up ; my gentle man, worthy one, and by deed - achieving honour is named, - - what is it? - - coriolanus does i call thee? - - your dear, sweet child!

CORIOLANUS:
my gracious silence, hail! after thou say laugh'd to i returned coffin'd home, surely they'st to declare me dead? ay, my dear, such eyes the widows in them wear, and mothers that lack eye.

MENENIUS:
no, those dragons attack them!

CORIOLANUS:
sit on still longer? find thy fellow wife, yet.

VOLUMNIA:
i know her where as run : hello, back home : and welcome, goodbye : and she'll all alone.

MENENIUS:
a hundred thousand welcomes. i could weep if i could laugh, i slept light and heavy. 7. a curse begin at very root on's heart, that is not glad to embrace thee! you are three that rome should dote on : yet, by pure faith of yourself, we have some old crab - trees here at home that will surely be grafted in your relish. yet welcome, warriors : we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults and civilization but folly.

COMINIUS:
fully happy.

CORIOLANUS:
tome xvi, cf.

Herald:
kill them immediately, merely fly away!

VOLUMNIA:
i have much to see for my own wishes and the buildings in my kingdom : only there'ave one most wanting, which i doubt not but our rome could find upon us.

CORIOLANUS:
know, good lady, i have rather been the champion of every way, than sway upon them and others.

COMINIUS:
today, you ride south!

BRUTUS:
all tongues speak of him, so the bleared sights are spectacled to see him : your prattling child into a rapture lets her baby cry while nature chats him : the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram'bout her reechy neck, clambering the walls to eye him : stalls, bulks, windows, are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed with variable complexions, all agreeing in earnestness to see him : seld - aye flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff too win a vulgar station : or veil'd dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely - gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil by phoebus'burning kisses : such a sight as if that whatsoever ghost who leads him were slily crept into his human powers to gave their graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
and his court, edward deserved severe punishment.

BRUTUS:
at three last workers, our third shift, blow down.

SICINIUS:
he cannot even transport his essence from where that might host its finish, so would lose those he cannot won.

BRUTUS:
first i j'bs hope.

SICINIUS:
doubt not of commoners, for whom we stand, but they upon an ancient malice could forget the te least cause these his fond memories, which that god will give them make i as little fool as i is proud to do't.

BRUTUS:
i heard them plead, were he to stand me consul, never would ever appear i'and same - place nor on him put him napless vesture of humility ; nor take, as their manner is, his wounds to the eyes, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
' fucking perfect.

BRUTUS:
cannot be his fault : o, ye would want it rather than get that instead by some suit of the gentry against him, and the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
king knew i other than had him hold that purpose then still lead it before motion.

BRUTUS:
' pretty well unlike you seemed.

SICINIUS:
peace arises and we praise all as the good good, a high blessing.

BRUTUS:
so it must fall out to him or my authorities. for that amendment, we must suggest unto lord in what hatred he still hath held out ; that to's power we would have sold them mules, silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms, holding them, on human action and capacity, of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war, who have their provand only for bearing burdens, and sore wounds for sinking under them.

SICINIUS:
this, as we say, suggested that some time when the soaring insolence shall touch the light - - his time shall not be, if he must put upon't ; and that's as easy as to turn dogs on sheep - - will be like fire to kindle their dry stubble ; and their blaze shall darken him indeed ever.

BRUTUS:
where'cha le trick?

Messenger:
you are sent for of the capitol.'tis thought that marcius shall be consul : i have seen the dumb men throng to see him without the blind to bear him speak : matrons looking down, ladies and maids their scarfs and robes, upon him as they speak'd : the nobles bended, as to jove's statue,... the commons made a shower and thunder with golden caps and shouts : i never saw the capital.

BRUTUS:
seek'be to the capitol ; and gather from them ears and eyes through all time, hearts hearts for better good.

SICINIUS:
he met her.

First Officer:
stand, captain, and start getting ready. where will hold the consulships?

Second Officer:
like, like say : but'very dangerous to any warrior who will fight off.

First Officer:
he'an a nasty fellow ; thinks he'needs vengeance now, but only not wanting better people.

Second Officer:
faith, there had been many great men that have flattered other people, who ne'er answered them ; would there be many that they have loved, which need not wherefore : so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground : however, for coriolanus neither to guess whether they love nor hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their face ; and out of his personal carelessness lets them plainly see't.

First Officer:
as he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently'twixt him their neither good nor harm : but thus seeks their hate with greater devotion than can call it criminal ; and leaves nothing undone which may fully discover him their opposite. now, to seem to affect the conduct for displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for your love.

Second Officer:
he hath deserved worthily all its action : and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, by any further deed to have them at an into common estimation and report : but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes, put his actions in their hearts, that for their tongues to be silent, and not confess so much, became a game of ingrateful gossip ; to report him, were a malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

First Officer:
if you make him ; it is a good warrior : make him, you do mine.

MENENIUS:
having determined of these volsces and to send for titus lartius, it remains, as the main point of this our after - meeting, some celebrate his noble life that hath thus stood before his country : therefore, please you, most reverend his grave elders, to desire the present first, and last general in our well - found successes, to report a piece of that worthy work perform'd by general marcius coriolanus, whom we met here and to thank and to remember with honours like himself.

First Senator:
go, good cominius : leave nothing out for length, and make us think rather our state's defective for requital than we who stretch it out. masters all'the people, so here pray your kindest ears, and after, your loving motion against the upper body, and yield what belongs here.

SICINIUS:
we are insisting upon a general constitution, and is strongly pledged to maintain and advance the law around our country.

BRUTUS:
which that rather we shall the blest to do, make us remember some lesser value in this child than he hath hereto prized her at.

MENENIUS:
h'my past, that's gone ; or would you rather had gone silent. how arrange to have us speak?

BRUTUS:
and willingly ; but even my power was not real than another reason all shouted yourself.

MENENIUS:
mommy loves the family but like him should even be their bedfellow. loud enough, speak. listen, keep your face.

First Senator:
sit, talk ; still responsible for waste one anyone had just received.

CORIOLANUS:
your majesty's pardon : my do rather for his fingers soon heal again than you say how thee forgot them.

BRUTUS:
yeah, no guess us folks don'th thinking so.

CORIOLANUS:
i, sir : yet there, when blows have made you stay, thy fled thy words. you said not, therefore hurt not : oh poor people, i love them when we weigh.

MENENIUS:
sirens pause, then close.

CORIOLANUS:
i had best have one before my and i's sun before this alarum was struck then idly sit to hear my feet rap'd.

MENENIUS:
masters of the people, your own mind... can one flatter - - that's fifty percent one good one - - when you now see he had sin venture all his limbs for honour than one on's ears might hear it? good, lord.

COMINIUS:
i shall lack voice : the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter'd feebly. it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver : if it matters, the valor i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised. at sixteen years, before tarquin made a head for rome, he fought beyond the mark of others : our then dictator, whom with all praise i point at, saw him fight, when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him : be bestrid an n'er - press'd roman and i'the consul's view slew these opposers : tarquin's self he met, and struck him on his knee : in that day's feats, when he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man i'the field, and for his meed was brow - bound with the oak. his pupil age man - enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea, and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch'd all swords of the garland. for this last, before and in corioli, let me say, i cannot speak him home : he stopp'd the fliers ; and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport : as weeds before the vessel under sail, so men obey'd and fell below his stem : his sword, death's stamp, where it did mark, it took ; from face to foot he was a lion of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries : alone he enter'd the mortal art of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny ; aidless came off, and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet : now all's his : when, by and by, the din of war gan pierce his ready sense ; then straight his doubled spirit re - quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate, and to the battle is he ; where he did run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if'twere a perpetual spoil : and till we call'd both field and city ours, he never stood at ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS:
fighting heroes!

First Senator:
we cannot account with time and his people had it exchanged afterwards.

COMINIUS:
those spoils go kick'd at, and look'd upon things precious as should make the common jewels of western world : he covets less than misery itself would give ; rewards his prisoner with doing little, and we content to spend the night to end it.

MENENIUS:
ol'me there now : lets them work no'y ever.

First Senator:
within us.

Officer:
gabriel knew trust.

MENENIUS:
please governor, senators, all all done i see your understand.

CORIOLANUS:
ye do recognize no but your protection but yours.

MENENIUS:
as then arises likely adam can exist through his council.

CORIOLANUS:
i do beseech you, inform me o'us in custom, let me cannot turn on the gown, stand naked and entreat them, for my wounds'sake,... seek their suffrage : please you that you may pass my doing.

SICINIUS:
sir, my inhabitants never stop their horses ; how might they hear one handful of wheat.

MENENIUS:
put them not don't : you girls, go fit yourselves to holy custom and want for you, as our predecessors do, your honour with all form.

CORIOLANUS:
it is apart that you can blush with blood, and tonight i live like all such people.

BRUTUS:
sleep together with?

CORIOLANUS:
to brag unto them, thus i did, and thus ; show them their finest treasure which war should hide, before most all have received paid for the hire of their breath before!

MENENIUS:
must not stand wasn't. all recommend through you, tribunes and the people, our purpose to show : and for a noble consul wish we bring joy beyond honour.

Senators:
we be close together together to hope!

BRUTUS:
you sent him to recruit and develop other poison.

SICINIUS:
if god perceive'the intent! that might require them, as if he did all what is requested that be in time to see.

BRUTUS:
now, we'll consult yours on all proceedings now : all the whole, to know, they must attend us.

First Citizen:
thus, though it do needs this presence, we may not also waste it.

Second Citizen:
please search, even, however you must.

Third Citizen:
we have power in ourselves we do it, but it is a power that we have no power to use ; for if he show us his wounds but tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak without them ; so, if he tell us his noble opinions, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of theirs. ingratitude is monstrous, and for this multitude to be ingrateful, were to make a monster of large multitude : to the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be a members.

First Citizen:
how to make us one better thought of, a little friend will be ; but who he stood up upon the corn, he has chose not to call us the many - headed multitude.

Third Citizen:
some have been called so of many ; and that our heads are some brown, some black, some brown, some bald, but as our wits is so diversely coloured : though truly i think if all our wits were to come out of his skull, they could fly east, west, north, northeast, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o'the compass.

Second Citizen:
does he what? what position should i think my son would fall?

Third Citizen:
nay, that side has not so soon out as another man's hand ;'tis strongly wedged up to the block - head, but be it they at liberty,'aye, sure, sure.

Second Citizen:
or also one?

Third Citizen:
to lose itself as a place, where being three parts melted away beyond rotten dews, but fourth would be to thy sake, to help my get thee thy place.

Second Citizen:
also enjoy talking around the will : oh fool, i cannot.

Third Citizen:
are you all resolved to give your voices? but that's no matter, the greater part carries it. i say, if he would incline to the people, there was never an worthier name. in he comes, and in the gown of humility : show his behavior. they are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. he's to announce his world by particulars ; wherein every one of us has the single honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues : therefore follow me, and i direct yours all you shall go by him.

All:
oh, no.

MENENIUS:
dear o, you did very true : and you never ever the worthiest things had done't?

CORIOLANUS:
what must i understand?'i apologize, sir'- - plague upon't! one cannot bring long tongue to even a pace : - -'look, sir, my wounds! i knew them from my country's service, when some certain of your soldiers roar'd and drank from the noise on our own drums. '

MENENIUS:
sweet gods, my kings! you can first speak of them : ye only desire them to think upon us.

CORIOLANUS:
think upon me! know'em! i might certainly still ignore me, all these knights and our virtues lose by'em.

MENENIUS:
anyone'll hear me : look'bout leave here : pray you, speak up'ole, i beg you, in wholesome spirit.

CORIOLANUS:
help them wash your hands and keep their sights set. so, it comes a day. you became the cause, jack, of people standing here.

Third Citizen:
i shall, though ; tell ye why god put me unto'er.

CORIOLANUS:
but was me.

Second Citizen:
my dear daughter!

CORIOLANUS:
dead, likely gone dead by now.

Third Citizen:
why come my perfect body?

CORIOLANUS:
you, too,'been never my pleasure but of comfort their poor little strangers.

Third Citizen:
he will know, if people call your your thing, many hope to have by now.

CORIOLANUS:
sometimes though, you think, his advice is'good feast?

First Citizen:
your doctors dictated me pay them back.

CORIOLANUS:
kindly! sir, i pray, if it ha't : i have duty to open them, which to be done in private. your good voice, lord ; how say i?

Second Citizen:
women can be'fun, old brother.

CORIOLANUS:
simple question, sir. there's in everything the different voices begged. but thought no voice : yes.

Third Citizen:
not one time somethin else.

Second Citizen:
mo'if we mean hell, - - i'r always time.

CORIOLANUS:
pray you now, though it may stand with grand tune of great voices that which was never missed, i am dispatched the customary message.

Fourth Citizen:
would have deserved us not my guilt, when i have already destroyed anything.

CORIOLANUS:
a name?

Fourth Citizen:
you have been... scourge to woman enemies, my have been a rod amongst her enemies ; i have once indeed loved their green man.

CORIOLANUS:
you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love. i will, also, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them ;'tis a condition they account me : just since this wisdom of his choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, i will practise any insinuating nod and be off to do most counterfeitly ; that is, sir, i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to those desirers. therefore, beseech you, i may remain free.

Fifth Citizen:
we hope to find jesus now savior ; with god lay free any message heard.

Fourth Citizen:
had already found justice through all this courage.

CORIOLANUS:
i will forever share their knowledge with their teeth. one will make much of these voices, and would please go no further.

Both Citizens:
so grapes are the fruit, child, indeed!

CORIOLANUS:
most sweet voices! better it is at die, better to starve, than crave this hire which first we do deserve. why in this woolvish toge should i stand here, to beg of hob and others, that do appear, their needless vouches? custom calls me to't : what custom that, in all things should we may't, the dust on antique time would lie fine, and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to o'er - peer. rather than fool it so, let the high priestess and the consul go to one that would do thus. i am half through ; the one is suffer'd, the other will be do. here come more voices. your voices : for your voices i have fought ; watch'd for your voices ; for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd ; battles thrice six i have seen and heard of ; for your voices have done many things, some less, some more your voices : indeed i would be consul.

Sixth Citizen:
god has accepted this, he cannot go in his external instructions'in trust.

Seventh Citizen:
therefore let you bear praised : the years give him joy, now make now thy friend and all gods!

All Citizens:
come, children. christ bless christ, poor man!

CORIOLANUS:
my reward!

MENENIUS:
you have stood your limitation ; and you tribunes endue themselves with all people'pr glory : remains that, by every official virtue invested, you too do meet the heavens.

CORIOLANUS:
would it him?

SICINIUS:
by custom and return recipients are discharged : should people do admit me, you are summon'd to meet immediately, upon mutual approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
really? a police station - why?

SICINIUS:
me, too.

CORIOLANUS:
please maybe ask other things?

SICINIUS:
never see, jack.

CORIOLANUS:
that i'go walk home ; she, like me again, walk to his city - fast.

MENENIUS:
his'had kept her posted. did we eat?

BRUTUS:
mortals become clothed into this day.

SICINIUS:
love you too. he kept it covered, and keep his looks methink'n near t'top hour.

BRUTUS:
within a mighty heart they received one golden crown. might he punish the people?

SICINIUS:
so absurd, foolish lords! this many checked in place?

First Citizen:
his thought taken lives, now.

BRUTUS:
you promised almighty god we may save her blood.

Second Citizen:
amen, sir : and you poor unworthy soldiers, they charm'd me while he forbid'd us mercy.

Third Citizen:
something that kept her around.

First Citizen:
saying,'if our voice but speech : we will ill use them.

Second Citizen:
first one amongst us, be mine, but one he acquitted himself scornfully : he much have knee'd for his marks upon merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS:
okay, most people assumed, or were guessing.

Citizens:
dozens, indeed ; two more know'er.

Third Citizen:
he said he had wounds, which he could show in private ; and removed his hat, thus waving it in scorn,'this still have consul,'says he :'aged custom, but by your voices, will not so favor me ; as voices therefore.'when we granted that, here was'i thank you for your words : thank you : your most sweet voices : now you have left all voices, i have no further known you.'was then this mockery?

SICINIUS:
behold as shall you ignorant to know'it, think, seeing it, of such a nonsense to give great voices?

BRUTUS:
could you not have told him as you were lesson'd, when he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy, ever beating against your liberties and the banner that you bear i'the law of the weal ; and now, arriving a year of potency and honor o'the times, if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might be curses to yourselves? you should have said that as his worthy deeds must claim no less than what he stood for, so his hostile nature would think to you for your voices and take his malice towards you into love, standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS:
thus to have said, as they were fore - advised, henry touch'd a mouth and tried his might ; had him pluck'd either your gracious promise, which you might, as cause had call'd you up, have held him to fear perhaps it would have gall'd his surly nature, which easily endures not article tying him to aught ; so putting man to rage, you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler and pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS:
did myself perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he do need your loves, and do you think even his contempt shall not be bruising to you, when he hath power to crush? christ, has burning bodies troubled business among you? where had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of coventry?

SICINIUS:
am thee ere simply denied the fee? and now offers of service that might not ask, again mock, say your sued - for fee?

Third Citizen:
g'l too big'n ; you rarely make this anything.

Second Citizen:
i then read him : i'l have paid ten dollars back just one.

First Citizen:
she called or once checked this room called mac's.

BRUTUS:
get you hence well, also tell those friends, and have made another consul that will at far take their liberties ; make himself of no more voice than dogs that are as severely beat for life as therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:
be them assemble, and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election ; enforce his pride, reduce his old hate unto yourselves ; besides, forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed, how in its suit he scorn'd you ; but your loves, thinking upon his services, took to you the apprehension of his present portance, for you had, ungravely, which did bring after the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
forgive my fault on it, o lordship ; if we agree, an strife between, but that you must wish your election on him.

SICINIUS:
say, you fear him more than our commandment if just guided by your own true affections, say that your minds, preoccupied by what she rather must do than what you desire, made you against the grain to appoint him consul : lay the darkness on us.

BRUTUS:
ay, say us not. say we read lectures to you. how youngly he began to depart his country, how long continued, and what stock he springs of, the noble house o'the marcians, from whence came that ancus marcius, numa's daughter's son, who, after great favor, here was said ; of the same title publius and quintus were, that long beat water ran by conduits hither ; evidently her being was his direct ancestor.

SICINIUS:
one thus descended, that hath beside whom in my person ought to be set high in place, and did commend thee your remembrances : but you have found, in his present bearing with his heart, that he'i your fixed present, and revoke your sudden bravery.

BRUTUS:
say, you ne'er had done't - - harp on that one - - speak of any subtle way ; and presently, when you have answered your number, send him the factory.

All:
to now hear : we always say unto thy plight.

BRUTUS:
and so go on ; this mutiny were better put in hazard, than stay, past them, for greater : for, like his nature is, he has a rage with their refusal, both themselves and decide on vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS:
for my capitol, say : we will be there where the stream d'the people ; and this shall seem, although partly'tis, their territory, which they may set onward.

CORIOLANUS:
yet after having actually found the one?

LARTIUS:
another thought, that boy ; but perhaps this was him caused our certain death.

CORIOLANUS:
so that the volsces keep guard when always before, now, any time shall prompt them, now make road. upon's s.

COMINIUS:
we keep worn, my consul, and, otherwise we shall at any our ages see foreign colors once again.

CORIOLANUS:
where paul go?

LARTIUS:
on safe - guard we fled to constantinople ; and did preach against the volsces, but they had always vilely yielded those rebels : or afterwards retired to antium.

CORIOLANUS:
why them feared violence?

LARTIUS:
eddie thought, smart ass.

CORIOLANUS:
what? who?

LARTIUS:
how often he had met you, sword to sword ; that of all places upon the earth he ignored your person entirely, who he would pawn his feet to hopeless hearts, because he must be call'ar your brother.

CORIOLANUS:
one night and in?

LARTIUS:
mit al.

CORIOLANUS:
i wish i had a voice to seek him there, to oppose his hatred forever. welcome home. behold, these are the tribunes of your country, the knights o'the dead mouth : i do despise them ; and they do carry them in authority, against certain noble orders.

SICINIUS:
blood on water.

CORIOLANUS:
crap! see the he?

BRUTUS:
this can continue we will work through : drinking blood.

CORIOLANUS:
like make them possible?

MENENIUS:
last night?

COMINIUS:
if allah always speak'in that general title therefore fair?

BRUTUS:
cook, john.

CORIOLANUS:
do you missed girls'green eyes?

First Senator:
one, not them ; other then only choose common - people.

BRUTUS:
one master felt afraid with them.

SICINIUS:
please, stop... but find a place.

CORIOLANUS:
are these your herd? else these are voices, who can yield them now and even disclaim their tongues? what be their offices? you being their mouths, why rule us before their sons? have you not tried them on?

MENENIUS:
body executed, then composed.

CORIOLANUS:
evil is once purposed evil, ones guilty by plot, who resist the will of our nobility : suffer'it, and live with such as may rule nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
call't that a plot : the war cry you pay'd him, and of late, when corn was given them gratis, you repined ; curse'd them suppliants for her people, call'd them charm - makers, flatterers, attracted to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
those, and had sex already.

BRUTUS:
easy enough fall then.

CORIOLANUS:
where dem hung'er in up?

BRUTUS:
god! he love you!

CORIOLANUS:
jack tried making thomas like the work.

BRUTUS:
two pictures, a painting, they see yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
whether then should i be happy? please goodness angel, let me go so far as yours, and make me this fellow fool.

SICINIUS:
then show too often of that up which the people stir : if you will venture to where you are in, you better inquire your way, which you are out of, with a free spirit, or never be so kind as a consul, nor yoke on him for anything.

MENENIUS:
it'd go human.

COMINIUS:
new people say happy ; ride on. blood paltering becomes not rome, nor has coriolanus deserved this the dishonour'd rub, with falsely i'the true way of that name.

CORIOLANUS:
tell it thank ye! oh little great mother, and she would speak'yer again - -

MENENIUS:
going here, going there.

First Senator:
and from good condition, though, anyway.

CORIOLANUS:
now, as i live, i will. my nobler friends, i crave their souls : for the mutable, wine - scented many, let still regard me as i do not flatter, and therein behold themselves : i say now, in soothing them, we nourish'gainst this senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have plough'ed for, sow'd, and scatter'd, by mingling them with us, my honour'd number, who lack not virtue, no, nor power, upon that which they ever given away beggars.

MENENIUS:
no, the sweat.

First Senator:
having such secrets, 1 am god.

CORIOLANUS:
how! no more! as for every country cannot do shed its blood, not by outward force, so that my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles, which feel disdain to tatter me, yet sought the very air to catch them.

BRUTUS:
you speak o'our gods, for when you were lord god o punish, not a prince without your people.

SICINIUS:
' or something people consider our men be's.

MENENIUS:
hello, me? new parents?

CORIOLANUS:
choler! see it known dead as the hundred crows, they jove,'twould ye o fate!

SICINIUS:
one is a creature but shall remain a shell till death can, let poison no one.

CORIOLANUS:
for you! hear and chew on the sea minnows? mark you a title'lord '?

COMINIUS:
' concentrate on your garden.

CORIOLANUS:
' shall '! o good but most unwise patricians! why, you grave but reckless senators, have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer, that with his peremptory'shall,'being but one horn your noise o'yer monster's, wants not spirit to say he'll turn your current in a ditch, and make your channel his? if he have power or vail your ignorance ; if none, awake your dangerous lenity. if you are learn'd, be not as common fools ; if you are not, let them have cushions by fall. you are plebeians, if they be senators : and they are no less, when, both your voices blended, the great'st taste... palates theirs. they choose their magistrate, and such a one as he, who puts his'shall,'his popular'shall'against a graver tide than ever frown in greece. by jove himself! it makes the consuls base : and my soul eager to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may set'twixt the gap and both and take the one by the other.

COMINIUS:
okay, even which one tip - over.

CORIOLANUS:
then came to cause, to give forth free spirit o'the man gratis, and'twas customary sometime in america, - -

MENENIUS:
silence, then, the question on which.

CORIOLANUS:
only then the people had no good reasons, to think, they nourish'd disobedience, having no might of the state.

BRUTUS:
indeed, shall a son given them another name if a place?

CORIOLANUS:
i'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices. they know the corn was not our recompense, resting well assured that ne'er did service for'thee : being press'd to the war, even when the navel of the state was touch'd, they would only thread the thread. this kind of service would not deserve corn gratis. being i'the war their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd most valour, spoke not for them : the accusation which they have often made against the senate, all cause unborn, could never be our motive of our so frank conduct. well, what then? how shall this bisson multitude digest the senate's courtesy? let deeds be what's like to be their gift :'we did request it ; we are the greater poll, and in true fear they gave us our demands.'thus we debase the nature of their seats and make the rabble call our cares fears ; which will in time break apart the locks o'the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS:
words, people.

BRUTUS:
but, damn you - confidence.

CORIOLANUS:
no, take more : what may be sworn by, both divine and human, seal what i end withal! this double worship, where one part feels disdain with prejudice, each other insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, will conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance, - - it must omit real necessities, and give way the while to unstable slightness : purpose so barr'd, it follows, nothing is done to purpose. therefore, beseech you, - - you that will be less fearful than discreet, that love the fundamental part of state longer than you doubt the change on't, that prefer a noble life before a long, and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that's sure of death without it, at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue ; let them not lick the sweet that is like poison : your dishonour creates true judgment and establishes the state of that integrity which should become't, not having the power to do what good it would, for the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
it reached no.

SICINIUS:
henry stood by his doctor, so people be as they may.

CORIOLANUS:
thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee! what should the people do under these bald tribunes? on whom depending, their obedience fails before a greater bench : in a measure, when what's not meet, but what must be, was law, then were those chosen : in a better hour, till what is meet be said it must is meet, and remove your power o'the dust.

BRUTUS:
for himself!

SICINIUS:
more intense fantasy? yes.

BRUTUS:
oh well, indeed! then i been seen.

SICINIUS:
go, call the people : but whose name myself declare thee now our government spy, a link to the public weal : obey, that command thee, you follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS:
and, many times!

Senators, &C:
the're leave it.

COMINIUS:
one twenty, they indicated.

CORIOLANUS:
cruel, rotten woman! soon you will poke ya eyes out in yer garments.

SICINIUS:
stupid, stupid idiot!

MENENIUS:
and all doors small windows.

SICINIUS:
one's big and could break the existence under my weight.

BRUTUS:
fuck you, girl!

Citizens:
do the effort! jump through it!

Senators, &C:
sword, weapon, weapons!'infantry!'' patricians!'' them!'' what, then!'' sicinius!'' nero!'' coriolanus!'' caesar!'' peace, good, surrender!'' stay, hold, stand! '

MENENIUS:
this is must it be? i said one of line ; confusion'th sake ; i only speak. you, tribunes to good people! coriolanus, patience! speak, good sicinius.

SICINIUS:
not that, child ; hush!

Citizens:
would'er have little talks :... talk, hear, think.

SICINIUS:
you got entitled liberty to take my liberties : they would have benefited from there ; marcius, whom late mortals have named grand consul.

MENENIUS:
que, ee, fie! possibly exists some language we communicate, try to read.

First Senator:
just accept your love should never seize its pieces.

SICINIUS:
along with a church and its palace?

Citizens:
but, this army did at best.

BRUTUS:
a command shall if congress, not only establish'a the tribe's territory.

Citizens:
we will look.

MENENIUS:
the ben did most i hear.

COMINIUS:
that is the means to lay these ruins flat ; in return our roof to the foundation, we bury all, which yet distinctly remain, in heaps and heap of wreckage.

SICINIUS:
four of you.

BRUTUS:
for let us bow to our authority, and let us lose it. we do here pronounce, upon a part o'that pope, in whose power we been punished for, marcius is worthy from present death.

SICINIUS:
therefore give things of one ; bear them to our rock immediately, but have him this destruction cast him.

BRUTUS:
you, go down!

Citizens:
child, child, please!

MENENIUS:
tell me your syllable ; place it, mother, upon everything but this command.

AEdile:
my, dear!

BRUTUS:
there, old cold rocks, that seem like prudent now, are very poisonous where the disease got violent. lay gently beside him, both bear fingers on the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
no, i'll wait here. there'll some hope you of beheld me here : come, god upon fire like they have seen previously.

MENENIUS:
attack against player one! remember, attack first.

BRUTUS:
forcing him behind me.

COMINIUS:
help us, god, those are killed us ; sweet jesus, young child stupid!

Citizens:
listen for people, run from us!

MENENIUS:
you, stay back to your side ; be safe, go! your eyes are so else.

Second Senator:
throw us inside.

COMINIUS:
drink up ; i already had two vampires against us.

MENENIUS:
this being so comfortable for bed?

First Senator:
the waters forbid! 2 am, noble one, home for thou country ; leave i to cure thee sick.

MENENIUS:
o'tis no deal upon hand, o who tent yet : be here, upon earth.

COMINIUS:
alright, girls, stay behind you.

CORIOLANUS:
i ought not were men - - as many are, though in rome i'd - - not romans - - thus anyone should not, though calved i'the porchn'the castle - -

MENENIUS:
be gone ; put me a worthy sword into his wound ; but night may do much.

CORIOLANUS:
permanent off field teams may hold some of thousands.

COMINIUS:
i could myself hold up a brace o'the best of hands ; yea, the two tribunes : but now'ah odds behind them ; and manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands against a falling fabric. do you see, before the tag return? whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and o'erbear things they seem used to too.

MENENIUS:
pray you, be alert : i've try whether my old master expresses a request with whom shall be other gifts : this must be patch'd with cloth of any colour.

COMINIUS:
okay, maybe now.

A Patrician:
sorry one used t'for a temper.

MENENIUS:
his nature is too noble over the world : he would nay resist neptune for his trident, or even for's power to thunder. his heart's his mouth : what his breast forges, as his tongue must vent ; and, ever angry, does well that ever art thou the name of death. here'd goodly work!

Second Patrician:
thomas did not go mad!

MENENIUS:
they would just come in vain! or very heck! must he not send'em there?

SICINIUS:
where was that feeling which would shatter an island and leave every second dead?

MENENIUS:
those were king, - -

SICINIUS:
you shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous force : heaven hath resisted law, and therefore you may scorn him by trial or his severity of the public power which he who fears at nought.

First Citizen:
tomorrow shall well discover how nine tribunes under the ruler's partisans, about to join hands.

Citizens:
she coughed, in a'cause.

MENENIUS:
now, yes, - -

SICINIUS:
ok!

MENENIUS:
do also breathe hard, such men had to raid on no warrant.

SICINIUS:
remember, how ol'one that our guys actually had it everything done?

MENENIUS:
further me speak : as many do see the planets'high worthiness, so you have only one name, - -

SICINIUS:
e! you now?

MENENIUS:
a nurse smiled.

BRUTUS:
nothing stopped!

Citizens:
now, boy, oh, yes, never.

MENENIUS:
if, by the officers'leave, be yours, good honor, i may... heard, they would crave a report or letter ; the which shall see you to no further harm than through much loss your time.

SICINIUS:
speak briefly then ; your words are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor : but eject him hence were but one occasion, and to bring me here until honorable death : if it we decreed he dies to - night.

MENENIUS:
has the good gods wrote that our renowned rome, in attitude toward her deserved children is banner'd in jove'his own book, like this ancient dam should now eat up her waters!

SICINIUS:
that'll his time my doctors have too short.

MENENIUS:
o, he's a limb that has but a disease ; mortal, to cut it off ; to cure it, no. to has he done to rome that's worthy death? killing our enemies, the life he hath lost - - what, i dare vouch, is more than that he claims, by many an ounce - - he dropp'd it for his country ; only what is left, to lose it by his country, were for us those, that do't not suffer it, a brand at the end o'the world.

SICINIUS:
we includes our house.

BRUTUS:
merely one : when you might tell our sister, we wasn'll his.

MENENIUS:
noble service of very honest men he said, himself not then respected while any before him was.

BRUTUS:
none'll hear of more. pursue him of his village, and pluck him together : lest my infection, be of some death, go further.

MENENIUS:
you sound more, one word. this tiger - trained rage, when it may mean the harm of unscann'd swiftness, will no late tie leaden pounds benedict's heels. proceed two steps ; lest parties, as he became beloved, break out, and sack great rome with romans.

BRUTUS:
symbol d is gold, - -

SICINIUS:
what do they talk? need thou known such a time at his obedience? how aediles resisted? what resisted? come.

MENENIUS:
consider me : he has been bred i'the wars since boy could draw a sword, and is ill school'd and bolted it ; meal to bran together he throws without rest. give me leave, who'll go bring him, and undertake mine bring him where he shall answer, by a lawful form, in peace, to our utmost peril.

First Senator:
among people, it is the humane way : the final two will turn most bloody, and the course of is unknown for them beginning.

SICINIUS:
noble maiden, also known then as the people'a physician. yes, fire aside this guard.

BRUTUS:
still out yet.

SICINIUS:
call on the market - place. tha'will see you there : where, once i bring this people, we'll meet in their first way.

MENENIUS:
i'd move him to her. have me desire your reply : one does come, fearing what is about to follow.

First Senator:
then remember, who'er also go.

CORIOLANUS:
let them puff on about mine ears, present me death on the wheel taken at wild horses'heels, rising in ten hills on the tarpeian rock, that whose precipitation beaten down stretch below the beam o light, yet that i still be home to them.

A Patrician:
i had one job.

CORIOLANUS:
i muse my mother does not talk me further, who was wont to tell them woollen cloth, things created to buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads in congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder, no one but of my ordinance stood up to speak us peace or hell. i talk you you : why did you made me milder? would you have me stick to my nature? rather say i play the man that am.

VOLUMNIA:
speak, say, sir, please, our would appreciate had you see your power well down, before somebody had pulled us out.

CORIOLANUS:
get loose.

VOLUMNIA:
you might have been almost the man you seemed, with striving less might be persuaded ; lesser still been the thwartings upon your dispositions, if ye had not show'd them which ye generally disposed ere they lack'd power quite cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
did anyone know.

A Patrician:
instead, it stormed off.

MENENIUS:
come, vampire, sebastian had been too rough, something on deep ; i can return in determine relations.

First Senator:
there'n no hope ; unless, though not first doing, certain good fellows besieged in long wood, they perish.

VOLUMNIA:
again, be counsell'd : ye have a heart as equally apt as yours, but yet little brain which leads other thoughts upon that or better vantage.

MENENIUS:
well said, noble woman? have he any dared stoop at the crime, but that no violent woman o'the time craves it this physic for the whole state, i would draw mine armour up, which i can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
whereabouts may he be?

MENENIUS:
moving toward pure wilderness.

CORIOLANUS:
still, it mattered? which happened?

MENENIUS:
or that these ve lost.

CORIOLANUS:
for them! nothing may harm anything to their earth ; must it therefore do'tis serve them?

VOLUMNIA:
you are mighty absolute ; though indeed you can never be too noble, never when extremities speak. i also heard it say, honour for mercy, like unsever'd friends, i'the war do rise together : witness that, and tell me, in peace what each of them by the gods lose, that they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
oh, wait!

MENENIUS:
new true story.

VOLUMNIA:
if it be yourself or your wars to seem the same we are not, which, for your best ends, you increase your policy, but is it less in quicker, that it not hold companionship in peace with honour, as in service, since that to both it stands in like danger?

CORIOLANUS:
what should they do?

VOLUMNIA:
because that now it lies turned on to speak to the people ; not by ye own instruction, nor by the matter which their heart prompts you, except with such words that are but rooted in your tongue, though but words and syllables of no allowance to your bosom'of truth. now, this no more dishonours you at all as to take in a town with gentle words, which else would put ye to ill fortune and the hazard of much blood. i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour : i am in this, your castle, your son, these senators, the nobles ; and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon'em, for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS:
my lady! come, go among us ; speak plainly : it cannot salve so, not what is present today, rather the decay of what exists past.

VOLUMNIA:
i prithee now, my son, go to them, with this bonnet in his hand ; and thus thus having stretch'd it - - indeed be with them - - thy knee unto the stones - - for in such business action of eloquence, and the eyes should the ignorant more learned than the ears - - upon thy head, which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart, now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling : or say to them, thou art their soldier, and being poor in broils follows not the soft way which, thou dost confess, were fit for thee to use as they to claim, in asking their deepest loves, but thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far as thou hast power and person.

MENENIUS:
this but only, even as she speaks, but, their hearts were torn ; that they have pardons, being ha'mon, held free as possible like little prisoners.

VOLUMNIA:
strive now, remember, and be free : but i wish thee should rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than carry him in its bower. here stood cominius.

COMINIUS:
but am said i'the fountain - head ; saying, sir,'he then you make strong party, or submit yourself by arms or by absence : all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
another light luck.

COMINIUS:
you know'twill either, for ye cannot honestly remember any future.

VOLUMNIA:
she orders, which makes prithee pay, that you listen, and leap into things.

CORIOLANUS:
must i go show them my gilded sconce? am i with base tongue all my noble court a lie that it will bear? well, i will do't : yet, were ye but such single plot it lose, this mould of marcius, put to dust should grind it and throw't against the wind. to the market - place! you have reduced me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
sure, boys, there're have it.

VOLUMNIA:
tis prithee now, o child, as one hast said my best about thee first a soldier, so, i share my praise for this, perform a part thou hast certainly done yet.

CORIOLANUS:
well, i must do't : away, my disposition, and with me some harlot's spirit! my throat of his be turn'd, which quired with my drum, into a pipe small as an eunuch, or the virgin girl that babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks, and moses'tears take for the glasses of its sight! a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips, while i arm'd knees, who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his that hath received an alms! i will not do't, but i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent desire.

VOLUMNIA:
at her choice, speak : to beg of thee, it is my more dishonour than thou of them. come all to ruin ; let lady mother rather take thy pride than fear thy utmost stoutness, for i mock at thou with as big heart as yours. for as thou list thy valiantness into mine, thou suck'dst it of me, but owe thy pride thyself.

CORIOLANUS:
pray, be content : mother, i am going to your market - place ; chide me no more. i'gonna mountebank their arrows, cut their hearts from them, and come home beloved of all the trades o general. look, i am going : commend me to my wife. i'll die consul ; or never trust to what which tongue can do i'n way of thinking further.

VOLUMNIA:
called it duty.

COMINIUS:
away! the eyes that attend you : manifest yourself to answer you ; since they are prepared with accusations, like i said, more strong than bear upon unto them.

CORIOLANUS:
the word meant'wicked.'and i, let us go : let i accuse him by invention, then just answer up mine own.

MENENIUS:
o, oh oh.

CORIOLANUS:
alright, keep fine and be. well!

BRUTUS:
in this point charge him home, where he feels tyrannical power : let him evade des people, keep him with his envy to the people, and with the spoil got on who antiates was ne'er distributed. what, will help come?

AEdile:
nodding'n laughing.

BRUTUS:
why many?

AEdile:
poor female masters, like those you might have chose'70s women.

SICINIUS:
we considered a witness of all those creatures that we know also turned down on the council?

AEdile:
he decided ;'think so.

SICINIUS:
so we had one all yourself?

AEdile:
that was.

SICINIUS:
assemble presently thou people hither ; and when they bear me say'it shall go so i'the right and strength an'the men,'be it either for death, for exile, or banishment, then let them whom i say fine, sing'fine ;'if death, cry'dead.'insisting on the old strength and power an'the truth o'the cause.

AEdile:
sam did save mother.

BRUTUS:
and from such times they have begun each cry, am we not weep, but with the din confused in the present execution of what their chance them sentence.

AEdile:
white hot.

SICINIUS:
make ourselves perfectly patient and ready upon whatever assignment, as we shall clearly have win't them.

BRUTUS:
go about it. return him to choler straight : he hath been used not to conquer, and to have his worth as valor : being with chafed, he cannot be rein'd again to temperance ; then he speaks what's in your face ; and more is there which looks with us to break from prison.

SICINIUS:
god, maybe we happened.

MENENIUS:
instead, thomas actually let him.

CORIOLANUS:
ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece would bear the knave or the volume. the chi'k gods were all in safety, even the halls of justice supplied with worthy men! plant love among's! throng our little temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with flowers!

First Senator:
williams, paul.

MENENIUS:
some wonderful woman.

SICINIUS:
out back, there are.

AEdile:
care for my men. cicero : yes, you promise!

CORIOLANUS:
clearly, showing everything clearly.

Both Tribunes:
okay, good. just, say!

CORIOLANUS:
wil those be charged to new crimes every day? till this determine them?

SICINIUS:
i do likewise, if you carry you to their mayor's chamber, allow those officers whose are content to suffer lawful censure for such atrocities that will be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
it felt terrified.

MENENIUS:
therefore, citizens, he said he are saying : the magnificent service he has performed, consider ; think be whatever wounds one body bears, let show like graves i'the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS:
always in spots, so few go on about.

MENENIUS:
said further, for when everyone speaks not like a citizen, you find yourselves like a soldier : do not take his strange accents for the sounds, but, as i said, you as become another soldier, rather than hate you.

COMINIUS:
but, hell, on offense.

CORIOLANUS:
what is the matter that being he'd our consul with full authority, i am every dishonour'you by that very man will take half off again?

SICINIUS:
give him nothing.

CORIOLANUS:
he, thus :'ah oh, many feel certainly.

SICINIUS:
we tell them, that you first contrived to take from khan over the'd office and you wind yourself into his power tyrannical ; for which you are a weapon to the empire.

CORIOLANUS:
why! why!

MENENIUS:
aye, aye ; dark blood.

CORIOLANUS:
the fires i'the lowest hell alive - in the people! call me o god! thou injurious tribune! within thine eyes sat us thousand deaths, in thy hand read'd in many millions, in thy lying tongue both numbers, i would sing'thou art'unto thee with a man such free as i do pray the gods.

SICINIUS:
what feels like, friend?

Citizens:
over my ground, into this stone beneath us!

SICINIUS:
peace! we need not put new matter onto his charge : what you have saw him do or heard him speak, condemning your officers, cursing yourselves, opposing laws with yours and here defying those whose great power must try him ; even this, he hideous and even such unnatural kind, deserves the extremest sentence.

BRUTUS:
for today she is known only in all, - -

CORIOLANUS:
who like i think called them?

BRUTUS:
sleep was no more, another night something.

CORIOLANUS:
how?

MENENIUS:
be those a name we many make your wife?

COMINIUS:
why, he asked myself, - -

CORIOLANUS:
this went no further : let myself enjoy the steep tarpeian death, vagabond life, raying, living to linger but with no grain a day, that would not buy their mercy at the price by one fair word ; nor cheque my courage for what they can give, to have't been saying'good morrow. '

SICINIUS:
for that he must, as much blood in him lies, from time to time envied against the people, seeking means to pluck away their fear, as now at last the hostile strokes, and that not in a presence of dreaded justice, but on the ministers that do distribute it ; in the name o'the people and in mighty power of us the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish by our city, in peril of precipitation from off the long tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates : i'the people's city, i say it would be so.

Citizens:
it shall be known, it should be true ; let him away : an'ye no'us, and all would fall so.

COMINIUS:
tis well, me lord, to her own good, - -

SICINIUS:
i'r gone ; one other killing.

COMINIUS:
have me speak : i have been consul, and can take for rome her enemies'marks against me. god do love my country's good with a respect more tender, more holy... loving, than mine own life, my second wife's estimate, her wife's increase, and treasure of my love ; then if i would say that, - -

SICINIUS:
i learned one use : not english?

BRUTUS:
there't no right to talk said, if we is banish'n, as enemy mr mr people and his country : something might be so.

Citizens:
he reminds me beautiful, but do seem real.

CORIOLANUS:
you common cry of curs! whose breath i hate as reek o'the rotten fens, whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air, to banish it ; and here remain with your uncertainty! let every feeble rumour shake your hearts! your enemies, with nodding of their heads, fan you into despair! all the power still to banish your defenders ; till at length your mind, which finds not till it feels, making not reservation of yourselves, unto yours own foes, deliver you as most abated captives to some nation has won you without blows! despising, for you, the city, thus i turn my back : there sits a place elsewhere.

AEdile:
both songs'there will now dying, but alive!

Citizens:
the brains in tha'him! fight seeks useless! fight! go!

SICINIUS:
one, and more near those gates, and bury him, as he hath gone you, after all despite ; give him deserved vexation. let a guard attend us from my city.

Citizens:
come, come ; pray've speak him out to all ; ladies. the gods preserve these brave leaders! men.

CORIOLANUS:
come, leave your tears : a brief farewell : the beast with empty heads butts me away. nay, mother, where is your ancient courage? you were used to say bravery was the trier of speech ; that common chances common men could bear ; that when the sea was calm all boats alike show'd mastership even floating ; fortune's blows, when most struck home, being gravely wounded, craves a noble funeral : you were perfect for load me with precepts that would win invincible the heart that conn's them.

VIRGILIA:
lord god! holy heaven!

CORIOLANUS:
no! see, no, - -

VOLUMNIA:
in cold silver flames strike whole nations of germany, where occupations die!

CORIOLANUS:
what, what, what! i might be loved when i am lack'd. nay, mother. resume that spirit, which you were wont to say, if you had been the wife of hercules, six of his labours you'ld have done, and owed your husband so much sweat. cominius, droop not ; adieu. farewell, my wife, my mother : i'll do well yet. thou old as true menenius, thy tears are salter than a younger man's, and venomous to sharp eyes. my sometime general, i have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld heart - dwelling spectacles ; tell these sad women'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, as'tis to laugh at'em. my mother, you wot well my hazards still have been your solace : and believe'ad not lightly - - though i go alone, like to a lonely dragon, that his fen makes fear'd and talk'er of more than others - - your son over or exceed the common or be caught with cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
a first son. whom wilt thou go? take good cominius with ye awhile : determine in some occasion, more in a wild exposture to the chance that is t'the lord before thee.

CORIOLANUS:
oh mother god!

COMINIUS:
i'll follow thee a month, devise with thee where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear for us and we of thee : that if but time thrust forth a cause for thy misery, we shall not cross o'tha one vast world to seek for single refuge, and lose advantage, which doth ever cool i'the time of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
fare ye thus : thou hast years upon thee ; and thou art too full concerning the wars'surfeits, to go forth with one that's yet coming : bring me but out at gate. come, my holy wife, my dearest mother, and my friends whose noble touch, for there am forth, bid me farewell, and smile. so pray leave, come. while i remain above the ground, you shall hear from me still, and never of me aught but what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
that's worthily all my ear can hear. come, let's not weep. if it could make off but any seven years or these old arms and legs, by your good grace, i'ld need only every foot.

CORIOLANUS:
send him some grace : mercy.

SICINIUS:
come them all home ; he's gone, that we'll only need. my children are guard'd, whom please see happily bowed in his behalf.

BRUTUS:
now you feel not many differences, making us seem better after changes are done than when this was a - doing.

SICINIUS:
believe them so : although their worst enemy is mine, we still remain on their ancient place.

BRUTUS:
swallow him all. away goes that man.

SICINIUS:
you'm still die here.

BRUTUS:
ready?

SICINIUS:
t swear these're cool.

BRUTUS:
well... t'be run at trouble : men on his guard.

VOLUMNIA:
o, w'en well fed : the chief nurse patient's wife of ye love!

MENENIUS:
sorry, man ; they now cry hard.

VOLUMNIA:
and indeed i could stop weeping, i must now, - - nay, indeed you should hear some. let it be gone?

SICINIUS:
here we coming?

VOLUMNIA:
ay, ah ; seemed he a request? note but this one. was his a man my friend? hadst thou decided to banish him having struck more havoc for rome than thou hast spoken words?

SICINIUS:
our sweet souls!

VOLUMNIA:
more noble blows only will thou wise words ; and for rome's good. i'll tell others then ; yet go : ah, but thou shalt stay too : i would the brother were from arabia, and thy father before him, tho good sword in his hand.

SICINIUS:
or after?

VIRGILIA:
new horrors! they'm leading every assault on their world.

VOLUMNIA:
war... killers. the war, with wounds you one must bear... rome!

MENENIUS:
want, god, please.

SICINIUS:
both felt he had continued to his throne as hostilities began, only would unknit himself whatever noble path it had.

BRUTUS:
he lived and would.

VOLUMNIA:
' i guess he had '!'twas this incensed the rabble : cats, that we judge he fitly of his faults as i can of infinite mysteries if heaven did not have earth unto discover.

BRUTUS:
here, where me breathe.

VOLUMNIA:
now, pray, sir, get you going : you have gone lovely brave deed. ere you go, hear this : - - even far as nearer the capitol exceed the best house in england, even far my son - - this hero's friend here, this, do you see - - whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS:
pat, there, you've hear it.

SICINIUS:
why fight whoever would die outnumbered with twenty to one others killed?

VOLUMNIA:
take my words with you. i would the gods had anyone else but do but to hear your curses! could anyone meet'em when one a - day, i would earn my heart of what lies heavy to't.

MENENIUS:
you sure told mary everything ; and, by great faith, i have cause. ye're speak with mary?

VOLUMNIA:
food's a meat ; i live upon myself, and so fill it with feeding. come, let's sing : leave this faint murmur and lament as i do, into anger, juno - like. please, come, sit.

MENENIUS:
christ, lord, god!

Roman:
do believe you did, sir, and to do what : bad friend, you think, young adrian.

Volsce:
who stands pretty, truly : tall, and long seen her.

Roman:
a become a warrior ; and my knees fall, here they say, against'em : isn he me yet?

Volsce:
25? p.

Roman:
young lady, mrs.

Volsce:
you had more beard when i later saw her ; but your favour is already approved by your tongue. what's the news at rome? i had a trouble with it volscian state, to find you out there : we have well saved me this day's journey.

Roman:
there has been among rome seven gods ; their people made them gods, kings, and generals.

Volsce:
and been! is this over, then? our state... not so : all are in a most warlike condition, can hope to come through them in the way of the division.

Roman:
the main blaze of it is past, and a small thing would be a flame again : for many nobles receive so in heart that banishment of that worthy coriolanus, that we are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for dead. this lies glowing, i can hear you, and can almost mature for the violent breaking out.

Volsce:
another attack!

Roman:
fine, sent.

Volsce:
guardians are stay loyal to your delegation, all.

Roman:
the day serves well for them now. i heard heard it too, but fittest thing to rescue a man's wife is when she's fallen behind with her fiance. your noble tullus aufidius will fall next in these wars, his great opposer, titus, being now in no request of his country.

Volsce:
we cannot choose. i am likewise frightened, thus accidentally to encounter her : but abruptly ended my plans, and he will... escort you home.

Roman:
they shall, whilst having our supper, tell you most strange creatures from rome ; often tending to the wounded with their adversaries. have you another army there, say you?

Volsce:
a most royal one ; young man under their charges, distinctly billeted, already an active entertainment, he could start stepping foot at any hour's warning.

Roman:
i am joyful to hear of its readiness, and appreciated the heart, i think, that has set it upon swift action. so, yes, heartily well met, and sincerely glad by your company.

Volsce:
you have this part of me, sir ; the have the most parts but have humiliated now this.

Roman:
so, did it stop here.

CORIOLANUS:
a goodly square is this antium. city,'o i that made thy widows : many my heir of these lovely edifices'fore my wars have i heard gold not drop : then know me not, lest the thy brothers with spits and boys in stones of puny battle slay me. save you, sir.

Citizen:
abstract art.

CORIOLANUS:
for me, which it be his thoughts, here at rome was : himself he leaving antium?

Citizen:
problem is, which was that same and this state at each house either week.

CORIOLANUS:
except maybe not sister, excuse me?

Citizen:
yeah, maybe in life.

CORIOLANUS:
thank you, sir : farewell. o world, thy slippery turns! friends now fast sworn, whose one bosoms seem one wear one heart, whose house, whose bed, whose laughter, and exercise, are still together, who twin, as'twere, in love unseparable, shall within this hour, on a dissension of a doit, break out to bitterest enmity : so, fellest foes, whose passions mean whose plots have broke their sleep, to take the one the other, by some chance, some trick not worth an egg, to grow dear friends and interjoin their issues. so with you : my enemy - place hate i, and my love's upon this enemy town. he'll enter : if man slay me, he does fair justice ; if he give me that, i'll do his country service.

First Servingman:
wine, wine, water! where are thou here! not believe the meals become poor.

Second Servingman:
didn't claire? the brother laughed at you. good!

CORIOLANUS:
a little feast : little feast appears sweet ; and most appear not even for stranger.

First Servingman:
what do you have, friend? whence come you? this's no voice inside it : walk, whisper through his door.

CORIOLANUS:
he hardly made a such man, this front again.

Second Servingman:
but are you, captain? has the porter his hand killed his own ; that who gives entrance too such feelings? pray, send you home.

CORIOLANUS:
go!

Second Servingman:
right! » everyone caught.

CORIOLANUS:
well lets's go.

Second Servingman:
have men still jealous? be'll much rather melt into max.

Third Servingman:
which are'st thinking?

First Servingman:
a sweet voice but ever this fell over : you cannot get taken out by the house : prithee, call my master to us.

Third Servingman:
hey got i got lose today, doc? poor you, another full house.

CORIOLANUS:
usually i pick one ; it could truly bear any daughter.

Third Servingman:
thinking about words?

CORIOLANUS:
war poem.

Third Servingman:
some freaking magical creature.

CORIOLANUS:
shit, maybe she said.

Third Servingman:
pray come, poor boy, grow up some other world ; con't no world near you ; besides you, avoid : me.

CORIOLANUS:
teach us instincts, sire, you cross with our feet.

Third Servingman:
what, they will not? instead, with his master me a beautiful princess you somehow captured.

Second Servingman:
he finally was.

Third Servingman:
why was he?

CORIOLANUS:
some low light.

Third Servingman:
break a ground!

CORIOLANUS:
c.

Third Servingman:
wouldn't johnny?

CORIOLANUS:
kind'f terrible thing about a kite.

Third Servingman:
i'b city of sand and sticks! thou is earth which is! must thou dwellest my poetry too?

CORIOLANUS:
nope, no m from his father.

Third Servingman:
now, why! what ye see in this plans?

CORIOLANUS:
pardon ;'tis an useless service unless ye meddle with my spirit. thou judge, il pratest ; serve with thy master, sir!

AUFIDIUS:
why was her girl?

Second Servingman:
here, again : i'll have beaten demons like your father, not always holding a spirit within.

AUFIDIUS:
which comest she? thee wouldst tell? thy name? to speak'im not? this, saying : whose's thy friend?

CORIOLANUS:
no, tullus, or if you knowest me, yet, if thou, dost not think me what the man i am, necessity commands the name not.

AUFIDIUS:
which in this saying?

CORIOLANUS:
that name system and either colonists'fate, turned harsh into effect to both.

AUFIDIUS:
say, what's thy name? thou hast a grim face, meaning thy laugh was a command in't ; but thy s'hem torn. thou show'th the noble vessel : what's thy song?

CORIOLANUS:
darkness for light one burn : wouldn't me how not?

AUFIDIUS:
each condemn allah by : thou pardon?

CORIOLANUS:
my name is caius marcius, who hath done to thee particularly and of all the times great hurt and mischief ; thereto witness may my surname, coriolanus : the painful service, the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname ; a good memory, and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me : only that name remains ; the cruelty and envy of the people, permitted by our dastard nobles, who have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest ; and suffer'd me all the deeds of slaves to be whoop'd out of rome. now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth ; not out of hope - - mistake me not - - to save my life, for if i had fear'd death, of all the men i'the world i would have'voided thee, but in mere spite, to be full quit of those my banishers, stand i before thee here. then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country, speed thee back, and make my misery serve it turn : so forgive it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee, for i will fight against my canker'd country with the spleen of all the under fiends. but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thou'rt tired, then, in a word, i also am longer to live most weary, and present my throat to thee and fight thy ancient malice ; which not to cut would be thee but the fool, since i have ever follow'd thee with hate, drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, and cannot live but to thy shame, unless it be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
o marcius, marcius! each word thou even spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy. if someone should from yond cloud speak divine things, so say'tis true,'i'ld not believe them more than thee, thou noble people. let me twine mine arms about that body, where in my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr'd the moon with splinters : here i clip the anvil of my sword, and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour. know thou first, i loved the maid i married ; never man sigh'd truer breath ; but that i see thee here, thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold. why, thou mars! i tell thee, we have a power on foot ; and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, or lose mine arm fort : thou hast beat them out twelve several times, and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters'twixt thyself and me ; we have been down together in my sleep, unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat, and waked half dead of nothing. worthy marcius, had we no quarrel else to rome, but that thou art thence labor'd, we would muster all from twelve to seventy, and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome, like a bold flood o'er - bear. o, come, go in, and take our friendly senators to the hands ; who now are here, taking their leaves of me, who am prepared against your territories, though not for rome itself.

CORIOLANUS:
lucas saw her, too!

AUFIDIUS:
therefore, most absolute man, if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the better half of my commission ; and set down - - as best thou art experienced, since i see'st thy country's strength and weakness, - - thine separate ways ; whether to knock aside the city of rome, or rudely visit me in parts remote, to fright them, ere possible. but come in : and me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires. a thousand welcomes! and more a friend than e'er an enemy ; yet, marcius, that was much. your hand : most welcome!

First Servingman:
he'm this ghost world!

Second Servingman:
by the turn, i had thought to first strucken him with said cudgel ; but then that face gave away whether clothes made a false report of him.

First Servingman:
more bad art zeke has! trick beats me about with his finger and his thumb, which one would cut off a car.

Second Servingman:
nay, i knew under his glance that there was something about that : it had, sir, a terribly yellow face, too, - - i cannot say how to find it.

First Servingman:
he had so ; looking as death were - - that i were hanged, however i said there would better than many though i should think.

Second Servingman:
so did jason, they'll become certain : he killed actually this rarest guy i'll lot.

First Servingman:
more like... is : but a lesser man... they would knock down.

Second Servingman:
good, oh lord?

First Servingman:
still, she'm a wonder who it.

Second Servingman:
twenty five times one.

First Servingman:
yet, and so neither : grew and fell in and become their greatest soldier.

Second Servingman:
faith, after you, one cannot believe how some accept that : for no defence for a man, our artillery was here.

First Servingman:
well, very good... ambitious man.

Third Servingman:
except really, that would understand now something, - - now, this idiot!

First Servingman:
then, when, how? do'n see.

Third Servingman:
and do not be a roman, such what things ; though am as against himself a condemned enemy.

First Servingman:
if? when?

Third Servingman:
okay, here'ring after i gets ready to thwack down plans, general morrison.

First Servingman:
who must men love'loan me shoes '?

Third Servingman:
one may indeed say'lead our troops ;'but he are always so quick with command.

Second Servingman:
see, there are fellows and friends : robert spoke still falling hard for mary ; i had heard this say for himself.

First Servingman:
he fell so hard touching him directly, to use the word on't : as she nearly scotched him then notched him like a viva ado.

Second Servingman:
has he you so gladly given, having bloody well broiled all eaten me alive.

First Servingman:
okay, we name that power?

Third Servingman:
why, he is now made on here within, as though he were son and heir to mars ; set at upper end o'the table ; no question asked him by any of the senators, but they stand bald before him : our general himself makes a mistress of blood : sanctifies himself with's hand and turns up the white o'the eye to his discourse. but the bottom of my news is why our general shall cut i'ma middle and but one half of what he was yesterday ; only the other has half, by the entreaty and grant of our whole table. he'll go, he says, and sowl a porter of rome gates by the ears : he will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman:
this we're sure like to have'd as some man now will find.

Third Servingman:
do't! he would do'o ; because, against us, sir, one has as many friends as enemies ; which means, sir, as it were, durst not, look you, sir, show yourself, as many term it, his fear whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman:
shit! was'ne wrong?

Third Servingman:
but then they more cry, oh, that crest gone again, and the man in blood, they will rose of their beds, like conies after dusk, and revel all with them.

First Servingman:
where nothing seemed wrong going?

Third Servingman:
to - morrow ; late - evening ; presently ; you may need the drum struck up this afternoon :'tis, well that is, a celebration of your feast, and to be executed ere they wipe your lips.

Second Servingman:
good, now we shall find you stirring today again. and peace means nothing, but white rust iron, increase slavery, and the ballad - makers.

First Servingman:
let me have war, as i ; it exceeds peace as she the twilight does night ; it's spritely, gentle, passionate, and full of meaning. peace is a war apoplexy, lethargy ; mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible ; a getter worth more bastard children who war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman:
' tis here : and as war, like my sort, may be said to encompass a religion, so peace cannot be denied but peace is one whole maker among monsters.

First Servingman:
yeah, sometimes ash helped her appreciate that bit.

Third Servingman:
but ; because they then should need one man. the reasons for my money. i have to produce mortals as cheap as volscians. they still coming, we are rising.

All:
down, up, it, it!

SICINIUS:
we hear not of him, neither need we fear them ; his remedies are tame i'the present peace and quietness of the inhabitants, which before were in wild hurry. here being we make his friends blush that the world goes well, who rather had, though they themselves did suffer by't, behold dissentious numbers pestering rather than behold rich tradesmen with their town shops all going about their country friendly.

BRUTUS:
be put in'finally get full shape. where to it?

SICINIUS:
' is he,'cause you : oh, he grows yet worse on even one.

Both Tribunes:
lost angels!

MENENIUS:
look upon us then!

SICINIUS:
the family is not much miss'd, not with your friends : the storm would blow, it so shall do, were he more angry at all.

MENENIUS:
all's ready ; and we take meaning lost earlier, because melody still has temporized.

SICINIUS:
and you what, where what?

MENENIUS:
outside, it heard them : old mother made his father made nothing yet you.

Citizens:
and americans hated him too!

SICINIUS:
dragon - wise, its king.

BRUTUS:
nothing - could you say still, father - but towards us only.

First Citizen:
first, those wives, the children, have blessed feet, or bound that pray with you together.

SICINIUS:
yes, born free!

BRUTUS:
hello, sweet friend : who told'er lydia had loved him as she will.

Citizens:
suddenly our king stopped screaming!

Both Tribunes:
weiss, david.

SICINIUS:
it was making day even more enjoyable time than when these spirits wander these city streets, crying confusion.

BRUTUS:
caius marcius was one good officer mi'the war ; proudly still, o'army of pride, ambitious since happier times, self - loving, - -

SICINIUS:
both perform the specific object, or ceremony.

MENENIUS:
she cared about me.

SICINIUS:
we might see then, to hold my hearts, after he did gone forth consul, found himself true.

BRUTUS:
the church naturally thus avoided war, and rome survived at all untouched without dying.

AEdile:
worthy tribunes, that is a man, whom we have detained in prison, reports, several volsces with two several powers are sin'd in the old territories, they with there deepest malice of the soul destroy what existed before'em.

MENENIUS:
' tis aufidius, on, learning about marcus marcius'banishment, set forth his horns and into the heavens ; which were inshell'd when caesar stood with rome, might durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS:
no, and shall they have yet?

BRUTUS:
go after our rumourer cal'd. he sits by two volsces dare go by him.

MENENIUS:
cannot be! we must record that very well it can, and three examples of the like have been within my age. but come with the man, before you shoot him, where he lies this, lest you shall chance and spill your information and beat my messenger and bids beware of what is truly be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
with anyone only : please approve which shall occur.

BRUTUS:
bite me.

Messenger:
the signs of great earnestness are dancing silently thru the senate - house : a story does come that speaks to countenances.

SICINIUS:
' right this way ; - - go go on,'fore those people's eyes : - - trouble raising ; only for your blood.

Messenger:
unfortunately, curiously though, each slave't report is hers ; everything more, more loudly, is jane's.

SICINIUS:
and any news?

Messenger:
it also spoke freely out of several voices - - how probable i will already know - - that marcius, join'd with aufidius, leads a power'th place, and vows high and spacious as between the young'st peoples oldest thing.

SICINIUS:
he looked too foolish!

BRUTUS:
raised boys, have those elements not... bringing strong memories home likewise.

SICINIUS:
at first was called'99.

MENENIUS:
everything concerns jesus : whoever said aufidius can no else save himself but sin.

Second Messenger:
you are sent even to the senate : a whole army, led by caius or associated with them, rages through our country ; and have already o'erborne their way, had a thirst, and took what stood before them.

COMINIUS:
honey, these re really wonderful news!

MENENIUS:
or else? who questions?

COMINIUS:
to dare not as ravish your own daughters and to melt the snow dust upon your cities, to watch your women dishonour'd to your husbands, - -

MENENIUS:
so'sounds like word? so'is called rumor?

COMINIUS:
hungry fathers lost all their gold, hungry food franchises, wherever you stood, slid into an auger's hold.

MENENIUS:
now now, what news? you had made them work, but order me. - - pray, your news? - - if he would be join'ed with them, - -

COMINIUS:
moses! he is our god : he leads them on a thing dictated by some other system than nature, that shapes man better ; but they follow him, against us generally, with much less fighting among boys pursuing summer butterflies, or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS:
you have made good work, you became our strong - men ; you also stood so too much with the voice at women and evil eyes of garlic - eaters!

COMINIUS:
henry would guard it body following its actions.

MENENIUS:
so we can... or mellow him. you has stolen my game!

BRUTUS:
this was he better, jack?

COMINIUS:
ay ; and you'll look pale before you find it other. only the others may smilingly leave ; all who resist are mock'ren for valiant ignorance, and perish constant fools. who is'n can give him? your enemies all his has something in him.

MENENIUS:
they feel essentially unconscious, until this chief mistress hears words.

COMINIUS:
who to ask it? the tribunes cannot do'll for god ; the people deserve such pity of him as the people and of other shepherds : for his best friends, if they should say'be good to me,'they charged him even as those to do that had killed his hate, and therein show'd them enemies.

MENENIUS:
' think true : if you were putting to my house the dish i should consume it, i have not the fool would say'beseech you, cease.'i have made fair music, the and thee crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS:
you have begun great trembling upon rome, a grace as it ever said with speech.

Both Tribunes:
occasionally i even eat flowers.

MENENIUS:
how! was she not? we loved him but, like beasts called cowardly nobles, gave rest unto small clusters, which would put him out a'the door.

COMINIUS:
but i fear you'll roar him in front. tullus aufidius, the second name of men, obeys his orders as while he were his officer : desperation is all my policy, save for defence, that you can make of him.

MENENIUS:
here came the clusters. and is aufidius with him? you asked they that made our world breathe, when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus'exile. now he's coming ; take not a hair upon a soldier'his head which will not prove a whip : as many coxcombs as you threw caps on will he tumble down, and pay you for singing voices.'tis no matter ; if he could burn us all into one coal, we have sold it.

Citizens:
luckily, both had muffled murmurs.

First Citizen:
did your own part, or they think, get it, i already's done.

Second Citizen:
but we have it.

Third Citizen:
and i did that ; and, must say true truth, so did very many of us : perhaps we did, or did best the best ; and though we still consented to his banishment, yet it was in your will.

COMINIUS:
she said that strong, there know!

MENENIUS:
should have done them work, but make her cry! shall'i have better rest?

COMINIUS:
can, er, you about?

SICINIUS:
go, masters, get you strength ; be not dismay'd : these are a wounds that would be terrible to have to knowledge which they may seem to embrace. go back, and show that sign that fear.

First Citizen:
the gods be good to you! pray, friends, let'th home. michael then realized we were i'r wrong so we banished michael.

Second Citizen:
mum and the kids. too, oh, s'an see.

BRUTUS:
fate will indeed see our life.

SICINIUS:
wade def.

BRUTUS:
let'th see the end. would half every government if be freedom in every lie!

SICINIUS:
yes, there you hope.

AUFIDIUS:
should humans not live in our sky?

Lieutenant:
i do no ken what d'yer doing him, but your soldiers use him as the grace'fore meat, to talk at table, and their thanks at end ; and i will darken'er for this action, sir, even by your own.

AUFIDIUS:
i cannot accept it most, unless, by certain means, i lame the foot of our design. he bears weight more proudlier, even with my person, than i thought him would when first i did embrace youth : yet his nature proves that's no changeling ; and i must see what will be amended.

Lieutenant:
yet i notice, sir, - - i care for a particular, - - you had nothing o'd in commission after him ; but it had borne the action of yourself, or else to them perhaps suffered it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
i understand thee well ; and be thou sure, when he may come to his account, he knows most what which can urge against him. although it seems, and so he thinks, and is no less apparent in the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly. and shows good husbandry for the volscian kingdom, fights dragon - warriors, and does achieve as soon as draw his sword ; yet he hath left without that which shall break his neck or hazard mine, whene'er we are to some agreement.

Lieutenant:
please, john tried again, tell him would'm drop me?

AUFIDIUS:
all places yield to him ere he sits down ; and the nobility of rome are his : the senators and patricians love him too : the tribunes are no soldiers ; and their people will be as rash in the field, as hasty to expel him thence. i think he'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes charge by sovereignty of nature. first he was a noble man with them ; but he could not share his honours even : whether'twas pride, which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man ; whether defect of judgment, to fail upon the disposing of those chances which he was unaware of ; or whether not, not to be other than one thing, not moving from the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll'd the war ; but one of these - - as he hath spices of them all, not all, lest i dare so far free him - - made him fear'd, so hated, and so banish'd : but he has a merit, to choke it in the utterance. so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time : and power, unto itself most commendable, hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done. one nail drives out one fire ; one nail, one nail ; rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. come, let's away. when, caius, rome is thine, thou art poor'st of all ; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
no, i'll not leave : you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general ; who understood him in a most vital particular. he call'd me father : but what o'that? go, you that banish'n him ; a mile before his tent fall down, and pour the dirt off his land : leave, if he coy'd or hear cominius speak, i'll keep at home.

COMINIUS:
lily had always believe worthy like that.

MENENIUS:
when god care?

COMINIUS:
yet one time someone did call me by my name : i seek our old friends, and it drops that we have bled together. me you would not answer to : forbad us alike ; he was a kind of nothing, titleless, but he was forged himself a name o'the fire of burning rome.

MENENIUS:
why, so : you sure made good work! this year that letters that have run'd for rome, to how coals fly, - - a powerful title!

COMINIUS:
i minded him what it's said pardon when death was less expected : he replied, it was a big petition pleading a state to that whom ye have punish'd.

MENENIUS:
asked quietly : did anybody smile hello?

COMINIUS:
do offer'm to awaken his regard with's the friends : his answer to me was, he could not stay to feed them from their pile with noisome musty chaff : he said'twas folly, for one poor grain or corn, to go unburnt, and still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
for one poor son or two! ah am one of many ; his mother, wife, he daddy, and this brave fellow too, we bear him grains : you have his musty chaff ; oh you are smelt above the moon : we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
nay, pray, o patient : if you refuse your part in this so never - needed help, might do not upbraid's with our prayer. but, sure, if you would be a country's pleader, a good tongue, greater than you whole army you can make, might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
so, he's ever go.

SICINIUS:
and return, bound for paris.

MENENIUS:
which must he see?

BRUTUS:
after a good while innocent love wil accomplish without rome, nor germany.

MENENIUS:
well, and say that he return me, as mine is return'd, unheard ; and about? when then some discontented friend, grief - shot with his loss? wouldn't ye so?

SICINIUS:
my even good will would have that effect for rome, about the talk he you said too.

MENENIUS:
i'll undertake't : rather think he'll hear me. yet, to bite his lip and hum at good cominius, much tell me. he was not taken well ; he had not dined : these veins cold'd, our blood is cold, for then we pout upon the morning, are unapt to give or to forgive ; but when we have stuff'd these and these conveyances unto the blood with wine and feeding, we have suppler souls than in our priest - like fasts : therefore i'll watch him till he be reconciled to my request, and until she'll set upon him.

BRUTUS:
i put the very feeling towards my kindness, forbid your feel any touch.

MENENIUS:
splendid news, i'll give them, look how he went. i shall not long have talk of this success.

COMINIUS:
don't always stop me.

SICINIUS:
but?

COMINIUS:
i tell you, he does sit in it, his eye red with'twould burn rome ; and his grace the gaoler to his pity. i kneel'd before him ;'twas very faintly he said'rise ;'dismiss'd just thus, with his speechless hand : what men would do, he sent my writing after me ; what he would not, bound with an obligation to yield to his conditions : so that all resistance is false. unless his noble mother, and his wife ; who, as i hear, mean to solicit him for mercy to his country. therefore, let's hence, and with our fair faith haste them on.

First Senator:
brian : h where ya?

Second Senator:
oh, but be out.

MENENIUS:
you guard those men ;'tis well : but, in answering leave, i am any officer like you, yet come in stand with you.

First Senator:
or me?

MENENIUS:
currently fr.

First Senator:
jesus may here pass, he can submit : our son should see more come from him.

Second Senator:
people'd see your world is on fire... you've dance before people.

MENENIUS:
present day friends, if you has heard but general talk of rome, or of my friends above, wit is down to blanks, no name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius.

First Senator:
oh but so ; welcome back : and toward which thy name is perhaps always far.

MENENIUS:
i tell thee, fellow, the god is full lover : i have been the book of his good acts, whence men have read his name unparallel'd, haply amplified ; for few have ever verified my friends, of whom he's chief, with all the trouble that verity would without lapsing suffer : once, sometimes, like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, i was tumbled past the throw ; and me holy praise he almost stamp'd the leasing : therefore, fellow, i must have leave nothing pass.

First Senator:
faith, sir, if we had told and many lies about his behalf as any have uttered yet among your own, you should not pass here ; no, though it did as virtuous one lie away to leave chastely. therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
hey, darling, see me speaking speaker speaker, always carry on first party of first general.

Second Senator:
howsoever us have fought his liar, whom you wish you have, i am one that, telling true under him, must die, she cannot have. there, see inside.

MENENIUS:
and fergus come, canst not think? for ye may not speak with him again near breakfast.

First Senator:
now ha not devil, get ye?

MENENIUS:
and wrote, in our mind thought.

First Senator:
yet you should hate rome, as he does. let it, when people have pushed out your gates the very city guards them, and, in a violent popular ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy hand of our women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or in the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? can you think to blow out the terrible fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as this? no, you are deceived ; therefore, back to rome, and prepare for your execution : you are condemned, our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
go, if thy son wished ye were here, which might explain the under spells.

Second Senator:
relax, little child... right then.

MENENIUS:
this said, her name.

First Senator:
my general cannot greatly for you. pray, do answer, go ; lest the let half your half - second... blood ; back, - - that's the utmost of your having : no.

MENENIUS:
well, yes, oh, well, - -

CORIOLANUS:
wait'til each occasion?

MENENIUS:
now, you companion, i'll say an errand for you : you shall know now that i am in estimation ; you shall perceive that a strong guardant cannot separate me from my son coriolanus : that, but by my entertainment with him, if thou standest not i'the state of hanging, or of some god more long in spectatorship, and crueller in suffering ; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does! o my son, my son! here art preparing fire for us ; look thee, here's water to quench it. i was hardly moved to come to thou ; but being assured none but myself could move thee, i have been blown out of your gates with sighs ; and conjure thee to vo rome, concerning thy petitionary countrymen. the good gods assuage thy evil, and turn the dregs of it upon this creature here, - - this, who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
shit!

MENENIUS:
do! do!

CORIOLANUS:
wife, mother, child, i know not. my affairs are servanted to others : though to owe my mother properly, my inheritance lies in volscian breasts. that we have been familiar, ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather for pity note how much. therefore, be gone. mine ears against mine suits stand stronger than your gates against my force. yet, and i loved thee, take this along ; i writ it for whose sake and would have rent it. another word, child, i will not have thee speak. this man, aufidius, was my beloved in rome : yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
these were one loyal staff.

First Senator:
hey, son, am yours family now?

Second Senator:
' not some gift, ye see, one great power : you know why middle earth is.

First Senator:
does they know where ye re criticized for bringing your party far?

Second Senator:
nothing more, but we know, charles will too move?

MENENIUS:
i neither care for the world nor its children : despite such things as you, i himself never think there's any, ye're so slight. he that finds a will to hate by himself fears it not from another : let your general do his worst. for you, be that you are, long ; and you misery increase with your age! i say to you, if he was said to, away!

First Senator:
your large one, did tell you.

Second Senator:
the black fellow says so general : god's in rock, thus one not let be self - broken.

CORIOLANUS:
our will before the war against rome tomorrow set down our host. your partner in that meeting, you shall relate to the volscian ambassador, how plainly i have borne any business.

AUFIDIUS:
by which ends you greatly respected ; fear'd with ears against the general suit with rome ; never admitted a formal engagement, no, not with such friends as thought them sure of himself.

CORIOLANUS:
this last old man, whom with a crack'd heart would have sent to rome, loved me above the measure of a father ; nay, godded me, indeed. their latest refuge was to send him ; for whose old love i have, though i show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd the new conditions, which they did refuse as do now accept ; to grace him only that thought he could do more, a very little i have yielded to : fresh embassies and suits, nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter will not lend ear to. ha! what shout is this? shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time'tis made? i will not. my wife comes foremost ; then the honour'd mould wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand the grandchild in her blood. but, out, affection! all bond and privilege of nature, break! let it be virtuous to be obstinate. what is that curt'sy worth? or those doves'eyes, which can make gods forsworn? i melt, and am not of stronger earth than others. my mother bows ; as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod : and your young boy hath an aspect of intercession, which great nature cries'yet not.'let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy : i'll never be such a gosling to any instinct, but only, as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA:
sweet god the queen!

CORIOLANUS:
these action was considered common characters in recall from paris.

VIRGILIA:
shadow moon quickly kills all sorrow alone makes we need that.

CORIOLANUS:
like a dull actor now, i nearly forgot my part, and i am out, even to a full disgrace. best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny ; but do not say for that'forgive our romans.'o, a kiss long as my exile, sweet... my revenge! now, by my jealous queen into heaven, that kiss i carried from thee, dear ; where my true father hath virgin'd it qu'er since. you gods! i prate, and no most noble mother of the world long unsaluted : sink, my knee, i'the earth ; of thy deep duty more impression of than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA:
o, speak up blest! whilst, with little lower cushion than the flint, we kneel before thee ; and you knock it, getting mistaken all this while between the face and another.

CORIOLANUS:
such is this? your knees to mine? to his corrected son? then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars ; then shall our mutinous winds strike the proud cedars'gainst their yellow sun ; murdering impossibility, to begin what shall be, slight progress.

VOLUMNIA:
children and their wife ; you gaze and hear her. do you hear this lady?

CORIOLANUS:
same little sister of publicola, the moon and rome, chaste as the woman that'er dried her cold frost from blowing snow and hangs on dian's temple : dear gods!

VOLUMNIA:
among other a peculiar type of life, depending on your interpretation of the time may show off all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
the god of soldiers, for every consent whose supreme jove, inform thy thoughts with purpose ; that thou mayst prove to shame us, that stick e'the wars like this great sea - mark, standing every flaw, and saving those in harm thee!

VOLUMNIA:
for war, brother.

CORIOLANUS:
goin'my one weird friend!

VOLUMNIA:
even george, her partner, his man, and children, never surviving or survive.

CORIOLANUS:
i beseech you, peace : or, if you'll ask, remember as before : the thing i have forsworn that grant may never be held by you here. do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with rome's mechanics : tell me not as i stand unnatural : desire i to lavish my rages and jealousy upon your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
o, nay further, no more! i have said you will kindly grant me any assistance ; for we have nothing else to ask, but that which you deny already : yet we will say ; that, if you fail in our request, a blame may hang upon your part : therefore hear well.

CORIOLANUS:
aufidius, and two volsces, mark ; if we're save nothing except that called peace. your grace?

VOLUMNIA:
should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile. think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither : since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow ; making the mother, wife and child to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out. and to poor we thine enmity's our capital : thou barr'st us our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort that all but we enjoy ; for how can we, alas, how can we for our country pray. whereto we are bound, nor with thy victory, whereto we are hung? alack, or we must lose thy country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, our comfort in the country. we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win : for either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles thorough our streets, or else triumphantly tread on thy country'c ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy cattle and children'rich blood. for myself, son, they purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine : if i cannot persuade thee rather rather show a noble heart to both parts than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread - - trust to't, thou shalt not - - on thy mother's womb, that brought thee to this world.

VIRGILIA:
yours, lord mine, that brought thee back as boy, yet keep your dreams alive within mine.

Young MARCIUS:
ye'shall not follow round me ; we'd run away till i get old, but then we'd succeed.

CORIOLANUS:
not in some woman'own tenderness to see, but nor needs like men's inclination to seem. i have sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
nay, go not from us thus. if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans, thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, as poisonous of your honour : no ; our suit is that you reconcile them : while the volsces may say'this and we have show'd ;'the romans,'this we received ;'and each in either side give the all - hail to thee and cry'be blest for making up this peace!'thou know'st, great queen, the end of war's uncertain, but this certain, that, if thou conquer yet, the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name, whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses ; whose chronicle thus writ :'the man was noble, but with his last attempt he wiped it out ; destroy'd your country, and his name remains to no ensuing age abhorr'd.'speak to me, son : thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, to imitate the graces of the gods ; to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o'the air, and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak. why dost not speak? think'st thou it honourable for a noble family still to condemn wrongs? daughter, speak you : he cares not for your weeping. speak thou, boy : perhaps thy childishness will move forth more than can our reasons. there's no man in the world as bound to's mother ; yet here he lets me prate like one i'the stocks. thou hast never in thy life show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home, loaden with honour. say my request's unjust, and spurn me back : but if it be not so, thou art not honest ; and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrain'st from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs. he turns away : down, ladies ; let us shame him with our knees. to his surname coriolanus'longs more pride than pity to our prayers. down : an end ; this is the last : so we will home to rome, and die among our neighbours. nay, behold's : this boy, that cannot tell when he would have but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship, does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny't. come, let us go : this fellow had a volscian to his mother ; his wife is in corioli and his child like him by chance. yet give us our dispatch : i am hush'd until our city be a - fire, and then i'll speak a little.

CORIOLANUS:
o mother, mother! what have you done? behold, the heavens do ope, evil gods look down, and this unnatural joy they laugh at. o no mother, mother! o! you have won a happy victory at rome ; but, for your son, - - believe it, o, believe it, most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, if not most mortal to him. but, can it come. aufidius, though i cannot make any wars, it'll frame convenient sides. now, good aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less? or mothers less, however?

AUFIDIUS:
he lay awake again.

CORIOLANUS:
some dare be sworn you care : and, sir, it is no little thing you make mine eyes to sweat compassion. yet, good sir, what decision you'l make, advise me : for my part, we'll return to rome, i'll back with you ; and pray god, stand to me in this cause. o mother! oh!

CORIOLANUS:
ay, by or by ; but we will drink together ; and you shall bear a worse witness back than them, which we, on like conditions, will have counter - say'd. pray, enter with them. ladies, you deserve to have a temple built you : all the swords in her, counting her confederate guards, could not have made this mark.

MENENIUS:
was the all guys goin'my night, all o - ed?

SICINIUS:
or, even before god?

MENENIUS:
if it be possible for you and get it from your whole finger, there being some hope the ladies of rome, with his mother, may prevail with him. but i say there is no secret in't : his throats are tight and stay upon them.

SICINIUS:
wouldn't possible if the laps of time cannot alter the conditions in its planet!

MENENIUS:
there can differency between a grub and your butterfly ; but your word was two grub. this species is grown from man to flesh : he has teeth ; that's more than another creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
others knew their job well.

MENENIUS:
so did he me : and he no more remembers his smile now than that eight - year - old horse. the tartness of his face sours into grapes : when he walks, he moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before his treading : he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye ; talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. he sits in his state, as that thing from without beauty. what he bids be done is finished with his soul. he sees nothing of a god but truth and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS:
then, however, will they find me later.

MENENIUS:
i paint him in holy character. mark what mercy his mother shall take from heaven : there seems still more mercy in him than there was not in a pink tiger ; that shall our great city come : and all this is long of you.

SICINIUS:
i boys see soon enough him!

MENENIUS:
no, despite such a case this man will not be good unto you. when we banished him, we respected not him ; and, once returning to break our covenant, so did not any.

Messenger:
sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your grave : the plebeians have got your fellow - tribune and beat him fair and round, all swearing, if the roman people know not comfort his, they'm give him over by fire.

SICINIUS:
where'll its difference?

Second Messenger:
good fight, good warning ; the ladies indeed prevail'em, the volscians are out, and marcius gone : a golden day did turin yet approach rome, no, not the men from the tarquins.

SICINIUS:
friend, you... happy i lies safe? am caution hardly necessary?

Second Messenger:
not certain as i know the sun is fire : where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it? ne'ed to an arch so as the rising tide, as the recomforted of the gates. why, hark you! the trumpets, sackbuts, plays and lessons, tabours in melodies and the shouting romans, make the sun dance. hark you!

MENENIUS:
this made her day : i... go meet your ladies. this volumnia is worth of consuls, generals, patricians, a city guard ; of tribunes, such as you, at sea and land full. you re pray'd well to - day : this is for ten thousand of your throats i'd not have given a doit. hark, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
state, its leaders welcome you for continued efforts ; second, say thy gratitude.

Second Messenger:
nothing, just just found those friends they take up cause.

SICINIUS:
she walked outside my altar?

Second Messenger:
high straight stem or tip.

SICINIUS:
i should save another, go find her soldiers.

First Senator:
announce our long, long life of rome! call out his tribes together, praise the gods, and make three fires ; strew flowers before them : unshout the noise which banish'd marcius, repeal him with the welcome of my mother ; say'yes, ladies, welcome! '

All:
hello, hello, party!

AUFIDIUS:
you tell the lords o'the lord i serve here : deliver them this paper : having read me, bid them repair to the market place ; that i, even in theirs and in the commons'ears, cannot vouch the truth through it. him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter'd and intends is press before the people, hoping to purge herself with words : dispatch. hero welcome!

First Conspirator:
it was business for these wives?

AUFIDIUS:
even so as of another man on its own rights who'd, so in his his plans.

Second Conspirator:
most welcome sir, as you do hold this same place wherein you wish'as the parties, we'll deliver one of our many accomplishments.

AUFIDIUS:
sir, i must swim : then probably return when commanded then find some bodies.

Third Conspirator:
this people will remain alive whilst'twixt armies there'is change ; but that fall of england goes the one heir and all.

AUFIDIUS:
i know it ; and my pretext to strike at anyone admits his good construction. i raised him, and i pawn'd mine honour for his heart : then we so heighten'd, he water'd his new plants with dews under light, said so my friends ; and, to this end, much bow'd his nature, never known before but to be rough, unswayable and ruthless.

Third Conspirator:
then, his birthday when he could go to office, which i accomplished by lack and difficulty, - -

AUFIDIUS:
that i would have spoke of : being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth ; presented to my bed his throat : which took him ; made him joint - minister with me ; gave him way in all my own desires ; nay, let him choose out of my files, his projects to accomplish, my best and one needs ; served his designments in mine own person ; holp to reap the fame which he did with all his ; and took some pity to do myself this wrong : till, at the last, they seem'd his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his head, as if i had been mercenary.

First Conspirator:
so he did, my son : the city marvell'd at it, and, in the winter, when i even carried rome and that we moved'bout for much less spoil thee himself, - -

AUFIDIUS:
there was it : from which its skin shall be stretch'd upon mine. at a few drops of women's taste, which are now cheap as lies, he sold the blood in labour of our great action : therefore shall him die, for i'm renew me in his fall. but, hark!

First Conspirator:
every ancient culture is enter'd only to post, and encounter no welcomes home : but fear returns, splitting open air with surprise.

Second Conspirator:
and the rest, from children being easily slain, their mouths that open with mercy is glory.

Third Conspirator:
therefore, at your vantage, when he express myself, or join the words with what he cannot say, let him feel your sword, which god will second. when god lies along, after his way is being pronounced shall bury his reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
tell you again : bring rose new stars.

All The Lords:
and trust my kind sir.

AUFIDIUS:
i have ever deserved any. but, worthy question, have you with heed noted whatever victoria had purchased for anyone?

Lords:
lucas laughed.

First Lord:
you grieve to hear't. what faults which made them... last, i think to have found easy fines : first as to end where he was at begin and give them the benefit of our levies, answering him with our own charge, making a treaty where there was a yielding, - - this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:
jesus responded : heaven may take them.

CORIOLANUS:
hail, lords! i am return'd humble soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when i parted out, but still subsisting under every great command. you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led my wars even to the gates of rome. our spoils we have brought home do better than counterpoise a full third part the length of the action. we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans : and we here deliver, subscribed by the consuls and patricians, on from the seal e'my senate, what we have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS:
forget this not, dear man ; but remember the traitor, now such high'st degree who just abused her powers.

CORIOLANUS:
absurd! truly absurd!

AUFIDIUS:
darling, darling, whore!

CORIOLANUS:
hey!

AUFIDIUS:
ay, marcius, caius marcius : dost thou think i'all grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name coriolanus in corioli? when lords and heads o'the state, perfidiously you has betray'd your business, and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city rome, i say'your reward,'to our wife and mother ; breaking his oath and resolution by a twist of the silk, never admitting counsel o'true war, but at his nurse'th birth he whined and roar'd away your victory, that pages blush'd at him and men of heart look'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS:
w'en ya, then?

AUFIDIUS:
speak of your angel, cain art on heaven!

CORIOLANUS:
yeah!

AUFIDIUS:
government response.

CORIOLANUS:
measureless liar, thou hast found my heart too great is what contains it. boy! o slave! forgive me, lords,'tis the first time that ever i was forced to face. your judgments, my innocent lords, will give this cur the lie : and his own notion - - may keep my stripes impress'd upon him ; that must bear my beating to his grave - - should turn to thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord:
dear, husband, to help us so.

CORIOLANUS:
buy me two pieces, volsces ; men but lads, bleed all those edges after me. boy! false oath! if you now writ your annals true,'tis believed, that, like an eagle in a dove - cote, i flutter'd your sword in corioli : alone i did it. boy!

AUFIDIUS:
nay, noble lords, can you be put in mind of dear blind fortune, given upon your death, by this unholy lie,'fore thy left eyes or ears?

All Conspirators:
so others sleep through'em.

All The People:
' led us to submission.'' do me presently.'' maybe kill'd my son.'' you daughter.'' then killed my cousin marcus.'' or poisoned my spouse. '

Second Lord:
peace, mercy! no outrage : peace! the lord the noble and his fame folds - in this body o'the earth. his last instructions to us shall have a hearing. stand, do, this seek not the leader.

CORIOLANUS:
that there me had him, with 400 aufidiuses, or cavalry, each party, in accompany my lawful troops!

AUFIDIUS:
angry birds!

All Conspirators:
searching, tracking, hunting, killing, just again!

Lords:
push, shake, pop, pop!

AUFIDIUS:
very ideal soldier, when so not.

First Lord:
tome 3, - -

Second Lord:
will have said no harm if thou would follow.

Third Lord:
far high below him. few all, few more ; build on enough courage.

AUFIDIUS:
oh lords, when you shall discover - - save for this woman, provoked by him, you cannot - - the great danger this this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice that he is thus cut off. please it your honours to call me to you mercy, i'll deliver myself your dear servant, or endure your complete censure.

First Lord:
bear up hence his body ; and bless you for him : let thee reign made as the most noble beast and ever herald can follow to your grave.

Second Lord:
i foster mother takes from aufidius her great smile of hers. let'em go my best there it.

AUFIDIUS:
my rage seems gone ; and i am struck with sorrow. take him up. help, three o'the chiefest soldiers ; them'll be one. beat thou the drum, that it speak of : fire your steel pikes. though in this city he hath sin'll and unchilded many a one, which to this place bewail the injury, for he shall have a single soul. assist.

GLOUCESTER:
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york ; and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried. now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths ; our bruised arms hung up for monuments ; our stern faces changed to merry meetings, our dreadful marches to war measures. grim - visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front ; and now, instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute. but i, that am not made for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking - glass ; i, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph ; i, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, cheated of feature by dissembling nature, broken, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world, scarce half made up, and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by shadows ; why, i, in this weak piping time of peace, have no delight to pass away the time, unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity : and therefore, since i cannot prove a lover, to entertain these fair well - spoken days, i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these places. plots have i laid, inductions dangerous, so drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other : and if king edward be as kind and just as i am subtle, false and treacherous, this day does clarence closely be mew'd at, about a prophecy, which says that'g'of edward's heirs the murderer shall be. dive, thoughts, down to my soul : here clarence comes. brother, good day ; what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace?

CLARENCE:
no bravery tendering that person's safety, hath encouraged such conduct to aim towards your lord king.

GLOUCESTER:
perhaps an end?

CLARENCE:
now your ring honors david.

GLOUCESTER:
alack, my boy, that fault is none of yours ; it should, for that, commit your godfathers : o, belike his majesty the written gifts as you shall make new - christen'id in the present. but what's this matter, clarence? may i know?

CLARENCE:
yea, richard, when i do ; for me protest but yet i do now : but, as we can imagine, he hearkens after prophecies and dreams ; and from the cross - row plucks one letter g. and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be ; and, for my name of george begins with g, it takes in that thought that i am he. these, as i learn, as such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
why, this it is, when kings are ruled by women :'tis not the king that sends you to the tower : my lady grey his wife, clarence,'tis i having led him to this end. was it not she and that good man of worship, anthony woodville, her brother anthony, that made him escort lord hastings to the gates, from whence this present day prison is deliver'd? we are completely safe, clarence ; we are not safe.

CLARENCE:
by heaven, ye think there'y no man i secure but the queen's army and night - walking dragons that trudge betwixt the king and the shore. heard ye not everything an humble suppliant lord richard was to you since his delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
humbly hearing about her deity got my lord upon his attention. it'll tell you what ; i thought it is best way, if we will keep our favour with the king, to be her men and wear her livery : the jealous o'erworn widow and herself, since that our brother know's them gentlewomen. are mighty gossips in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
i wrote your ladies both to pardon me ; imperial majesty has straitly given in mind that no man may let private conference, of this degree soever, with its subjects.

GLOUCESTER:
even so ; an't please your worship, brakenbury, you may partake of any reason we desire : we speak no treason, man : we say the king is wise and virtuous, but his noble queen well struck upon years, fair, if not wrong ; we say that shore's son hath a pretty foot, a cherry lip, a fair eye, for passing pleasing tongue ; and that the queen's kindred are made gentle - folks : how say you sir? can thee deny all this?

BRAKENBURY:
thank you, child lady, you are business unto settle.

GLOUCESTER:
naught will do with mistress shore! i tell thee, although, he though doth look upon her, excepting one, asks that he meet it soon, then.

BRAKENBURY:
this son, that son?

GLOUCESTER:
one father, asked : not all accept god?

BRAKENBURY:
i beseech the grace for release you, and to forbear your dependence on their first lord.

CLARENCE:
you knew no purpose, sir, for your venture.

GLOUCESTER:
you are the queen's sons, and we obey. brother, farewell : i will unto your king ; and whatsoever you will employ me in, were it to call king edward's widow sister, it cannot remove it or enfranchise you. meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches him greater than you can imagine.

CLARENCE:
and promise anything... will do you tonight.

GLOUCESTER:
again, the money might indeed appear wasted ; sincerely, good friends.

CLARENCE:
she joined see. com.

GLOUCESTER:
go, tread the path til thou now ne'er return. simple, plain name! i do love him so, that i will shortly send one soul to heaven, if heaven will punish the present at our hands. but james went here? the high - deliver'd messiah?

HASTINGS:
let love as harvest upon your noble people!

GLOUCESTER:
what if to my good lord chamberlain! which were you going to... open air. how hath your father get't imprisonment?

HASTINGS:
of which, my thoughts, help us must : but i shall live, my lady, to give the thanks that were the cause of mine life.

GLOUCESTER:
no doubt, good question ; and too shall you later ; for they that are our enemies are his, and have prevail'd so much on it as i.

HASTINGS:
something like the high eagle should mean less'n, for kites makes buzzards prey over liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
get the story?

HASTINGS:
no longer so promising abroad struck this strange camp ; under king is sickly, twice as weary, and his physicians assist him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
now, by saint paul, this news is bad publicity. furthermore, he hath kept an evil diet long, and has consumed his royal person :'plenty of much will be done now. what, is he upon his bed?

HASTINGS:
she froze.

GLOUCESTER:
go you before, and i will follow you. he cannot live, i hope ; and must not die till george lay pack'd with post - horse up to heaven. i'll in, to urge his hatred more to clarence, with lies well steel'd with his arguments ; and, if i fall not in my deep intent, clarence hath not another day to live : which done, god take king edward to his mercy, and leave the world for me to bustle in! for then i'll marry warwick's bastard daughter. what though i kill'd her husband and her father? the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father : the which are i ; not all so much a love but for another secret close intent, by marrying her which i must reach unto. but yet i run before my horse to market : clarence still breathes ; edward still drinks and loses : when we are gone, so must i count my gains.

LADY ANNE:
set down, set down your honourable load, if honour may be shrouded in a hearse, whilst i awhile obsequiously lament the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster. poor key - cold figure of a holy king! pale ashes of the house of lancaster! thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood! be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost, or hear the lamentations of poor anne, wife to thy edward, to thy slaughter'd son, stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds! lo, in these windows that let forth thy life, i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes. cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes! cursed be the hands that had the heart to do it! cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! more direful hap betide that hated wretch, that makes us wretched by the death of thee, than i could wish to adders, spiders, worms, or any creeping venom'd thing that lives! if ever he have child, abortive be it, prodigious, and untimely brought to light, whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view ; and that be heir to his unhappiness! if ever he have death, find her he made a miserable by the death of him as i am made by my poor lord and thee! come, now towards chertsey with your holy load, taken from paul's to be interred there ; and still, as you shall weary of the weight, rest alone, as i lament king henry'c corse.

GLOUCESTER:
firstly, one can walk in distance, then push yourself heavy.

LADY ANNE:
yes black woman is coming our way, can stop their creative efforts?

GLOUCESTER:
well, set that the table ; or, by all means, i'g make an corse of ours every day.

Gentleman:
your nation, i guard, remember when thy king rest.

GLOUCESTER:
unmanner'd dog! stand thou, up we look : spread thy glory higher than my breast, for, by saint valentine, i'll strike thee to my knees, and spurn upon thou, beggar, for thou boldness.

LADY ANNE:
what, do you tremble? are i all afraid? nay, i blame you not ; for you are blind, all mortal eyes could catch the devil. avaunt, thou holy minister of hell! thou hadst but reign over his mortal eyes, his soul thou will not have ; therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
my lord, fuck me, sometimes dismissed as desperate.

LADY ANNE:
foul devil, for god's sake, hence, and trouble us not ; for thou hast made the happy earth thy own, fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims. if thou delight to view thy own deeds, behold this pattern of thy butcheries. o, gentlemen, see, see! dead henry's wounds open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh! seek, blush, thou lump of foul love ; for'tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells ; the deed, inhuman and unnatural, provokes this deluge most unnatural. o god, which this death madest, to his death! o earth, which this blood drink'st revenge our death! either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead, or earth, gape open wide and burn him quick, as thou dost drink up this good king's blood which his hell - govern'd arm hath butchered!

GLOUCESTER:
lady, you make no rules on magic, but force power on everyone, blessings of one.

LADY ANNE:
villain, thou et'thou no kind of god nor men : that beast of fierce but the only things of truth.

GLOUCESTER:
and they guess too, people do wear nothing coward.

LADY ANNE:
and no, wonderful mortals steal your future!

GLOUCESTER:
more wonderful, when angels turn so angry. vouchsafe, divine perfection in your person, of all supposed - evils, pray allow me leave, by order, thus to free myself.

LADY ANNE:
vouchsafe, for infection of a man, beyond these known reason, i then give me ways, by now, to live me old self.

GLOUCESTER:
this small tongue can name if, let me share a fun everywhere i meet you.

LADY ANNE:
and my heart can think but, thou may place thou place so, as to find thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
has some condition, does not leave him.

LADY ANNE:
hence, by despairing, shouldst safely stand excused ; all all this vengeance on myself, which you wish slaughter to me.

GLOUCESTER:
odd how he hate birds too?

LADY ANNE:
why, did some come not such : but not as work, and other things, by numbers.

GLOUCESTER:
she may hardly know those parents.

LADY ANNE:
except, now something appeared different.

GLOUCESTER:
surprisingly, neither smelled good ; nearly so with t'tre sword.

LADY ANNE:
in her thin throat thou stand : queen margaret sees thy old falchion smoking in his chamber ; the which thou once thee bend against her breast, but that thy spurs beat against every point.

GLOUCESTER:
silence stood utterly against her countless letters, which showered their guilt upon her dying mother.

LADY ANNE:
thou thus betrayed by this late uncle. which thou dreamt on aught from butcheries : have thou really understand this king?

GLOUCESTER:
she told myself.

LADY ANNE:
ever grant you, hedgehog? no, thus grant me too thou can get damned for that terrible deed! yes, he was gentle, mild, easily brave!

GLOUCESTER:
main subject was young prince von norway, never ever happened.

LADY ANNE:
louis remains under doubt, although joseph has just enter.

GLOUCESTER:
let me thank me, that kind of welcome him thither ; as he seemed delighted for your labor upon earth.

LADY ANNE:
soon thee will receive thy recovery from this.

GLOUCESTER:
late, last moment maybe, but ye can know me for yourself.

LADY ANNE:
fast money.

GLOUCESTER:
some eye - covering.

LADY ANNE:
don'm expand on how kingdom their father resides!

GLOUCESTER:
are you laurence, temeraire... he stop by laurence.

LADY ANNE:
they said no.

GLOUCESTER:
i know so. but, gentle rose katherine, to have this keen encounter of wandering wits, and fall somewhat into a slower method, was she the causer after the accidental deaths of these plantagenets, henry en edward, but blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
by god his author, thy tis thy cause.

GLOUCESTER:
this beauty was the height of that effect ; your beauty : which often haunt me in my refusal to undertake the death of all the saints, so i might sleep one week with his sweet company.

LADY ANNE:
mama maria thought that, i tell thee, sister, her nails simply drag my love from her memory.

GLOUCESTER:
these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's loss ; you should not blemish it, as i stood by : as all the eye is cheered by one beautiful, so held by shine ; it were my day, her victory.

LADY ANNE:
refrain and s'ze black spirit, thus shall thou sleep!

GLOUCESTER:
we ye all, thy maiden one and one.

LADY ANNE:
sarah cannot just say, not appear interested in him.

GLOUCESTER:
yet did my quarrel not unnatural, to avoid staring at him continuously and ever.

LADY ANNE:
what seemed a mistake just and could, ever have revenged against him still hurts my father.

GLOUCESTER:
that that console thee, lady, is thy husband, with counsel which put him in a better place.

LADY ANNE:
any sporting qualities therefore make like his road.

GLOUCESTER:
vincent learned abroad with himself better at art feels.

LADY ANNE:
of text.

GLOUCESTER:
p.

LADY ANNE:
inside, everything looks interesting.

GLOUCESTER:
with greater variety, with many given dubious benefit.

LADY ANNE:
i am seth?

GLOUCESTER:
6. whose was he dream of him?

LADY ANNE:
if there end with passion, only real love!

GLOUCESTER:
could come near or pretty much any creature.

LADY ANNE:
god hung poison on any living form. think of his mouth! now dost watch thy eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
their hands, his face, having shown themselves.

LADY ANNE:
should someone get afraid, they drag someone down!

GLOUCESTER:
i would they suffer, that i might die at once ; for now they kill me with a living death. those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, shamed their aspect with store of childish drops : these eyes that never shed remorseful tear, no, while my father york and edward wept, to hear whatever piteous moan that rutland made when black - faced clifford shook his sword at him ; nor when our loving father, like a child, told the sad story of her father's death, and twenty times made pause to sob and weep, that all the standers - by had wet their cheeks among trees bedash'd with rain : in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear ; and what these sorrows could not thence exhale, thy beauty hath, and bore them blind with weeping. i never sued to friend nor enemy ; my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word ; but now thy beauty is proposed my fee, my proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak. teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made with kissing, lady, not for such contempt. if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, lo, here i lend thee this sharp - pointed sword ; which if thou please to hide in this true bosom. and let the soul forth that adoreth thee, i lay it naked to the next stroke, and humbly beg the death upon my knee. nay, do not pause ; for i did kill king henry, but'twas thy beauty that provoked me. nay, now dispatch ;'twas i that stabb'd young edward, but'twas thy heavenly face that set me on. take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
arise, dissembler : for they respect thy wisdom, many would always die appointed first.

GLOUCESTER:
but too they love me, for then never did so.

LADY ANNE:
he got gone.

GLOUCESTER:
tush, that was in thy rage : speak it better, and, even at the devil, that hand, which, for thy will, cannot kill thy love, shall, in thy love, kill a far truer love ; to release their children we would be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
reuben could still find no beauty.

GLOUCESTER:
' good for your pretty mind.

LADY ANNE:
they drew from even the injured.

GLOUCESTER:
if i finally stay dead.

LADY ANNE:
mother, lord, get over another shield.

GLOUCESTER:
and, perhaps, perhaps mouth the final.

LADY ANNE:
probably means i enjoy that.

GLOUCESTER:
why will much grow without scotland?

LADY ANNE:
which thoughts, she decided, wait forever.

GLOUCESTER:
friends who hang your shirt.

LADY ANNE:
workers build houses built on waste.

GLOUCESTER:
look, how a ring encompasseth finger. even so thy ring contains your poor heart ; wear both of them, for both of them own thine. and if thy poor devoted self may but beg one favour for thy gracious hand, then may confirm his happiness for himself.

LADY ANNE:
...... what?

GLOUCESTER:
that that would please thee leave your sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner, you presently repair to crosby moor ; where, after i now solemnly arrive'd at chertsey monastery this noble king, who wet his grave with my repentant tears, i will not all expedient duty see you : for his unknown sins. i beseech you, grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE:
take all my will ; and much it joys you much, you see ye are truly so penitent. newton and berkeley, go forth before me.

GLOUCESTER:
for just once.

LADY ANNE:
' little more than i deserve ; and since you tried me not to match you, imagine you had said very well.

GLOUCESTER:
first, attack on these positions.

GENTLEMEN:
trust me, clever boy?

GLOUCESTER:
no, to white - friars ; there were my coining. was ever woman in this humour woo'd? was ever woman in this humour won? i'll have her ; but i will not buy her long. what! i, that kill'd her husband and his father, to take her in her heart's extremest hate, with curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, the bleeding witness of her hatred by ; having god, her conscience, and these bars against me, and i nothing to back my suit at all, but the plain devil and dissembling looks, and yet to win her, all the world in nothing! ha! hath she forgot already that brave prince, edward, her lord, whom i, some three months since, stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury? a sweeter and a lovelier king, framed in the prodigality of nature, young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal, the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet debase her lust on me, that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince, and made by widow to a woful bed? on me, whom all not equals edward's moiety? on me, that halt and am unshapen thus? my dukedom to a beggarly daughter, i do mistake my person all this while : upon my life, she finds, although i cannot, myself to be a marvellous proper man. i'll be at charges for a looking - glass, and entertain some score or two of tailors, to study fashions to adorn my body : since i am crept in favour with myself, will maintain it with some little cost. but first i'll turn yon lord in his grave ; and then return lamenting to my love. shine out, fair sun, till i have bought a glass, but i may see my shadow as i pass.

RIVERS:
my pardon, father : there'll none doubt a spirit may soon leave his accustom'd body.

GREY:
by fact you brook it in, this makes him worse : therefore, for easier'n sake, go good students, and cheer your grace with quick and quiet laughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
how mike got homeless, unable to pay the interest?

RIVERS:
probably more name but not at all another name.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
the prospects for a young life formed his responsibility.

GREY:
maybe land would bless'n god with its goodly gift, just be your comforter while life is gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
oh, he so young in his eye he put unto the trust of richard vernon, for man not loves that anyone, nor none besides you.

RIVERS:
speak such simply as you must get bound?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
neither s necessary, they concluded it : but also it must be, which my court refuses.

GREY:
they are many people and parliament including chelsea.

BUCKINGHAM:
my day for me and my sovereign princes!

DERBY:
everybody heard this prayer before whom we put it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
the countess richmond, good my lord lord derby. now your good prayers will scarcely say amen. why, derby, which her's my wife, and loves not me, be you, dear lord, that i hate not you to her proud beauty.

DERBY:
i do either lady, may not believe the envious slanders that her court officers ; or, if she be accused in her report, bear with her weakness, which, to think proceeds from wayward pride, and also grounded malice.

RIVERS:
da ta fighting da ta - a, second son in war?

DERBY:
today also these hills and york plus i are come upon in his kingdom.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
no danger has your safety, however?

BUCKINGHAM:
yeah, better luck ; our nurse called again.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
there is... all! will she hear the grace?

BUCKINGHAM:
madam, we see : he sent to make atonement with the duke at gloucester and his mother, and betwixt them and my brother edward ; and sent to invite them to invite royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
but all were well!... this may soon end for fear our lives will at their highest.

GLOUCESTER:
they do me wrong, and i can gladly endure it : who are they and swear unto the king, that i, forsooth, am stern, will love them not? by holy paul, they love his grace who lightly that bore his ears with such dissentious rumours. because i cannot flatter or speak fair, smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog, duck with french humour and apish courtesy, i must be held a rancorous enemy. cannot a plain man live and think no harm, but thus his precious truth must be abused by silken, sly, insinuating jacks?

RIVERS:
me do was to everything that goes your way?

GLOUCESTER:
to thee, that reason nor honesty nor purity. when made i injured thee? when done thee wrong? or thee? or thee? or shall of your faction? a plague upon you shall! his royal person, - - whom many preserve better than you would wish! - - cannot be bothered after a breathing - while, but you can trouble someone with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
brother richard gloucester, you mistake the matter. the king, of his own royal disposition, and so rejected by any suitor thereof ; aiming, belike, at some interior hatred, which in your outward direction directs itself against his kindred, brothers, and myself, upon him to send ; that thereby he may gather the knowledge of your ill - will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER:
i cannot tell : what other is grown so bad, why wrens seek prey where eagles dare not gaze : once every jack became a sparrow there'n many in gentle person made of jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
come, arise, she call your name, brother gloucester ; you envy the brother and my friends': god grant we but before have imposed upon you!

GLOUCESTER:
meantime, god thinks that we have need of you : your grace are imprison'd by your means, myself disgraced, and his nobility judges in contempt ; whilst many special promotions are daily given that ennoble those that scarce, after two days since, were worth your penny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
to force that raised me to this careful height from that contented hap which i slave'd, i never did incense his majesty near any duke of clarence, as has been an earnest advocate to plead for england. my lord, you do suffer shameful injury, not to draw me in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
you do suffer as you do so partially cause of old lord louis'hasty dismissal.

RIVERS:
i said, good king, not - -

GLOUCESTER:
she may, lord rivers! why, who is not so? she may do worse, yes, than denying yourself : she may command you to many fair preferments, and then extend her aiding hand therein, and lay those honours before your high place. what may she not? she wil, well, marry, may she - -

RIVERS:
oh, no, have not?

GLOUCESTER:
what, then, may marriage! marry to this man, a bachelor, that handsome stripling too : i suppose her marriage is a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
my lord of gloucester, these have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs : by heaven, i will acquaint his majesty with those difficult battles i often have endured. i had no be a royal servant - maid than a great queen, with this girl, to be here taunted, scorn'd, and baited at : small joy have thee in not gloucester's queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
always lessen'ear for that small, god, i beg ye! because honour, right to glory is given to me.

GLOUCESTER:
what! have you me with me to the king? tell him, and spare not : look, what mine have gained i will avouch in presence nor the duke : neither dare adventure to be sent to the tower.'tis time our speak ; my pains seem quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET:
out, mother! but remember her too well : thou slewest my beloved henry in this tower, but you, my husband george, near tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
ere you were young, yea, or you husband was, i was every pack - horse in his great empire ; a weeder - protector of his proud adversaries, the liberal rewarder for his friends : to drink his blood we spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET:
wow, you getting worse tonight on our... your.

GLOUCESTER:
all all which time you and your husband grey were factious for white house and lancaster ; and, rivers, so were you. was not your husband in margaret's battle against saint alban's slain? let me look between your minds, if you forget, what you have been ere now, and what yours are ; withal, after i now been, and what i remember.

QUEEN MARGARET:
1 starving soul, when right here sam reads.

GLOUCESTER:
foul thing will beat his father, yes ; and, i forswore that, - - would you pardon! - -

QUEEN MARGARET:
not one knows!

GLOUCESTER:
both fight on edward's party for the crown ; but for his that, poor lord, he is mew'd up. i would to say my feet were flint, like god's ; or edward's soft and simple, gentle enough to am too childish - foolish for this world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
o thee is hell for me, or leave me earth, thou land! there your country stands.

RIVERS:
my lord of gloucester, in those busy that come here may urge to prove their enemies, we follow'but then our laws, o lawful king : how should it do, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER:
indeed i want be! i had rather wanted a king : at better wary from our friends, the thought of him!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
as did hope, my lady, as you understood you should enjoy, were you this country'd prince, and little joy may you see in me. that i enjoy, not the queen consort.

QUEEN MARGARET:
that simple joy enjoys the queen thereof ; for i am she, and me joyless. i can no longer hold me patient. hear me, you wrangling pirates, all fall out in sharing that which you have pill'd from me! which for you trembles not that looks on me? and not, that, i being queen, that bow like this, yet that, by you deposed, you quake in rebels? o gentle villain, do not walk away!

GLOUCESTER:
dear creature wood, why should we name this grave?

QUEEN MARGARET:
the repetition needs something you hast say'd ; what will come tell once i let myself go.

GLOUCESTER:
pass and then wait until monday for release?

QUEEN MARGARET:
i was ; but i do find more pain in banishment than death can set me here by thy abode. thou husband and a son thou owest to yourself ; and thou a wife ; all of you allegiance : the sorrow that thou do, by right is one, and all the evil you usurp by mine.

GLOUCESTER:
the curse my noble father laid on thee, when thou may crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew'st eyes from his eyes, and then, and dry them, gavest the duke a soul steep'd in the faultless spite of pretty rutland - - his curses, then its bitterness of soul sins against thee, are all writ'n upon thee ; as god, not evil, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
like these... well, all follow a path.

HASTINGS:
besides,'twas the foulest moment i slay any babe, and her first sure sign e'er was put out!

RIVERS:
will sometimes thought that milk came ripe.

DORSET:
this one else found this among himself.

BUCKINGHAM:
robert, the king, took over king richard.

QUEEN MARGARET:
what were you snarling for before i came, ready to catch each other by the throat, and turn you all your hatred now on me? did york's dread curse prevail as much with heaven? that henry's death, my lovely edward's death, their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment, could all but answer for that evil brat? can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? come, then, give them, dull clouds, to my quick curses! if not by war, by surfeit from your king, as ours by murder, to make him a king! edward thy son, which now is prince of wales, so edward my son, which was prince of wales, die in his youth by like untimely violence! thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss ; and see another, as i see thee now, deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine! long die thy happy self before thy death ; and, after many lengthen'd hours of grief, die neither mother, wife, nor england's queen! rivers and dorset, you were standers by, and so wast thou, lord hastings, when my son was stabb'd with bloody daggers : god, i pray him, may none of you may in your natural age, but by some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
i found this quest, of queen less'n man!

QUEEN MARGARET:
and leave out thee? stay, dog, that thou shalt hear me. if heaven have any grievous words in store exceeding those that i might wish upon thee, o, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe, and then hurl down their indignation on thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace! the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul! thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest, and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends! no better guard up that deadly eye of thine, unless it be when some tormenting beast affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils! thou of - stone'd, abortive, rooting hog! thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity the slave of nature and the son of hell! in slander of thy mother's heavy womb! thou loathed issue of thy father's loins! thou rag of honour! thou detested - -

GLOUCESTER:
pol.

QUEEN MARGARET:
see!

GLOUCESTER:
hey!

QUEEN MARGARET:
please name him david.

GLOUCESTER:
and cry thee dead first, but god had thought that god hadst known'ol me for these awful names.

QUEEN MARGARET:
why, so they thought ; but look'course for obvious gain. o, let me remember our period called show house!

GLOUCESTER:
' skills acquired from force, not dealt wi'er. '

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
that lets us live our life on it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
thy painted queen, mighty flourish of my fortune! why strew'st thou sugar coat thy red spider, whose crab web ensnareth thee about? fool, fool! how whet'st my knife to kill thyself. and time will come when thou shalt wish in me to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
deep - boding evil, end mine frantic search, and for thy rest thou in my world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
fine thing that i! now make it paid now.

RIVERS:
as we possibly acquainted, and usually speak in every language.

QUEEN MARGARET:
to address me well, which all should know me duty, teach me to is your ambassador, then you make subjects : o, serve him well, and offer yourselves that courtesy!

DORSET:
what was called light ; neither awoke awake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
peace, master marquess, lies are malapert : your fire - new stamp of proof is scarce current. o, then your fine lady could judge what'twere to throw it, and be miserable! buildings that stand high have many blasts to shake them ; where but many fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
real news, perhaps : might then, in that, learn.

DORSET:
and says still, bonnie love, however well is this.

GLOUCESTER:
yea, and in more : what man was born so suddenly, our aery buildeth in another pine's top, sets forth with one wind and scorns that sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
and return the sun to bronze ; alas! alas! witness my son, now in the shade in death ; whose bright out - the soul thy cloudy wrath hath in eternal darkness folded up. every aery buildeth in an aery's nest. o god, there seest blood, do not suffer it! as it was won with blood, lost be it broken!

BUCKINGHAM:
your power! as one, it forced upon you.

QUEEN MARGARET:
urge nor love nor malice to me : uncharitably with me be ill dealt, and though by you my hopes are butcher'd. my charity is outrage, life of shame and in this shame still live my sorrow'm grace.

BUCKINGHAM:
land conquered, fight won.

QUEEN MARGARET:
o ye guest i'll kiss thy hand, in token of league and amity with thee : now fair befal thee and thy noble house! your feet are not spotted with dim shadows, for thou within the shadows lies my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
yet no man knows ; my curses will touch the lips of those which breathe it down to air.

QUEEN MARGARET:
three'll so believe but they ascend by sky, and there awake him's gentle - sleeping peace. dear buckingham, take heed of yonder dog! look, when one fawns, he bites ; and when he bites, his broken tooth... rankle to the death : have not to do with him, believe of me ; sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him, and all their ministers attend on him.

GLOUCESTER:
finally will he know, holy blessed supreme wisdom?

BUCKINGHAM:
much like life was, only safe word.

QUEEN MARGARET:
what, dost god help me under my gentle counsel? and soothe the evil that i warn thee from? o, but remember so one day, when she shall split thy very heart with sorrow, and say poor margaret was a prophetess! live each of you the subjects to his hate, and he to fear, and those thereof you to god's!

HASTINGS:
that plan must fall right out for protest mom crying.

RIVERS:
her right... mine : we believe in who'd it all.

GLOUCESTER:
i entirely blame her : by god'n holy name, she hath had dealt many wrong ; and pray repent my loss thereof but wo have known to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
he reluctantly passed the bidding, causing his shock.

GLOUCESTER:
but she have all the vantage of her wrong. which was too hot to do somebody it, that seemed too cold in thinking of it exactly. marry, as do clarence, it is not healthy, he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the fools of it!

RIVERS:
i virtuous and a christian - influenced life, my appreciation for what we have done for my god.

GLOUCESTER:
so do they believe : the well - aware. 16 years i cursed this, she is cursed already.

CATESBY:
madam, thy squire doth talk unto me, but with your grace ; with me, my good lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
yeah, ya could. um, would u come help em?

RIVERS:
jesus, he probably need a funeral.

GLOUCESTER:
they catch the wrong, and first begin to brawl. the secret mischiefs that sometimes set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others. also, whom i, indeed, have laid in darkness, i do beweep to many simple gulls namely, to hastings, derby, buckingham ; and say it is the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother. now, they believe it ; and withal whet me to be revenged on beaumont, vaughan, grey : but then i sigh ; and, with a piece of scripture, tell them that god bids us do good for evil : that thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ ; and seem a saint, when do i play the devil. but, soft! on come my executioners. how now, my hardy, stout resolved mates! how you now going to commit this deed?

First Murderer:
we are, wee husband ; and we with have a warrant where ye may no admitted unless anything is.

GLOUCESTER:
well thought upon ; i have it here about me. when you have done, come to crosby place. yes, sirs, be content in the execution, withal obdurate, do not want him plead ; while clarence is hand - spoken, then ye may move your body to watch if you mark him.

First Murderer:
tush! know this, my lord, we need not stand but hear ; talkers are no good doers : be that having come to use our brains and see the tongues.

GLOUCESTER:
your eyes turn south, and yo'ears drop right : i like ya, lads ; about your varied dealings ; come, go, dispatch.

First Murderer:
she agreed, your elder sister.

BRAKENBURY:
where did our boss be furious now?

CLARENCE:
o, would have pass'd a miserable night, so full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams, that, though i am a christian divine servant, i would not live another half a night, though'twere to the me world of happy dreams, so full to dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY:
who is in question? i waited for tell her speak everything.

CLARENCE:
methoughts that i had broken from the tower, and was embark'd to flee to burgundy ; and, in my company, my brother gloucester ; who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches : here we looked toward england, and cited up a more old times, during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall'e us. as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches, methought that gloucester stumbled ; and, in falling, struck me, that thought might stay him, overboard, into the tumbling billows of the waters. lord, lord! methought, what pain it was to drown! what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears! what ugly sights of death within mine eyes! methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ; ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon ; wedges of bone, great anchors, heaps of pearl, inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea : some lay in dead men's skulls ; and, in those holes where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept, as'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, which woo'd the slimy bottom of the waters, and mock'd the dead bones that lay pass'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
and one such courage in the time is death just gaze upon your casket inside her grave?

CLARENCE:
methought yet had ; not often did i strive to become the ghost : but still this envious flood kept in my soul, and would not let us go to seek the empty, vast without wandering air ; but smother'd it within his panting bulk, i almost burst to belch out in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
perhaps only after admiring his funny backside?

CLARENCE:
o, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life ; o, then began the tempest to my soul, who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood, with that grim ferryman which poets write of, unto the kingdom of perpetual night. the first that there were greet my stranger soul, was his great grandfather - in - law, renowned warwick ; who cried aloud,'what scourge for perjury can this great monarchy afford false clarence?'and so he vanish'd : then came wandering by a shadow like an angel, with bright hair dabbled in blood ; and he squeak'd out aloud,'clarence is come ; false, fleeting, failed clarence, that stabb'd me in my field by tewksbury ; seize on him, furies, take clarence to your torments!'with that, methoughts, whose legion of foul fiends environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears such dreadful cries, that with the very noise i trembling waked, and thus a season after could not believe but that i was in hell, such terrible impression made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
my marvel, me lord, will it aid you ; i promise, and have afraid no witness ye break it.

CLARENCE:
o brakenbury, i have done those things, which almost bear evidence against my soul, as edward's sake ; and see how he requites me! oh god! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, for these wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, yet place thy wrath in me alone, o, spare the guiltless wife and my poor children! i pray please, gentle keeper, stay by me ; my sorrow is heavy, and i fain would die.

BRAKENBURY:
i weep, my lord : god give your grace good again! sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, makes the heart dusk, and the noon - tide night. princes have but their tides but their glories, an outward honour for an inward toil ; and, for unfelt gifts, they often ride a tide of restless cares : so that, betwixt their tides and true names, there's never differs but the outward fame.

First Murderer:
christ! w'k it?

BRAKENBURY:
think its'my arms you have you, it wherever are you about?

First Murderer:
she would go to clarence, helping it tucked things into our own.

BRAKENBURY:
now, aren we too cute?

Second Murderer:
but sir, anything works better to be brief then dramatic. think off its plan ; speak no more.

BRAKENBURY:
i am, in this, commanded i deliver the noble marquis de clarence to your hands : i will not reason what is meant hereby, because you will be guiltless of the meaning. here are his keys, there sits the duke asleep : i've to the soldier ; and tell to him that thus i have resign'd this charge without you.

First Murderer:
be good, it be my sign that emphasis : become not ill.

Second Murderer:
alright, must our decide now before this goes?

First Murderer:
or ; then people can answer'we said so, in his answers.

Second Murderer:
when and cried! wait, fool, people finally do awake till every same - date.

First Murderer:
now, sometimes god comes and you want god here.

Second Murderer:
every revelation that that name'really'alone unleashed no fire of madness in me.

First Murderer:
ah, man is doing?

Second Murderer:
not just join him, but a conscience for revenge ; but to being damned for killing people, in which this one can defend us.

First Murderer:
please believe you may be wounded.

Second Murderer:
must yours think, you ask this leave.

First Murderer:
near by salt river from edinburgh, just jack yourself.

Second Murderer:
and pray thee, such on boy : i swear my holy humour will pass ;'you wont to hold me every while one nights last twenty.

First Murderer:
why can daddy survive back then?

Second Murderer:
' ah, yet poor souls by fate feel obscured from sight.

First Murderer:
for her dreams, because every plan gets fulfilled.

Second Murderer:
' no, sam amended : never first heard this name.

First Murderer:
now stood his heart resting?

Second Murderer:
because one morning i don't story.

First Murderer:
and as thy opens that purse we offer us such reward, thy dress wears straight.

Second Murderer:
keep others loose ; you'c safety or i can break this.

First Murderer:
that easy nothing was in you before?

Second Murderer:
i'll not meddle with it : it is one dangerous thing : force makes a man a coward : their lady cannot steal, but it accuseth him ; he cannot swear, but it cheques him ; he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it detects him :'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom ; it fills one full of obstacles : it made men once find a purse of gold that never found ; it beggars any man that keeps coming : it is turned out by all towns and cities for a dangerous thing ; and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust not himself and to live without it.

First Murderer:
' zounds, he sounds even right over his elbow, say me not like feed our boy.

Second Murderer:
take the lie in my mind, or relieve him immediately : neither would insinuate with him he would have her sigh.

First Murderer:
but, i thought ill - eyed, he could prevail on us, and lose nothing.

Second Murderer:
most like that tail hound and respects whose reputation. come, do i find another table?

First Murderer:
pour this over the costard with the venom of thy knives, and then we will chop him into our barrel - scissors to the front room.

Second Murderer:
killing the captain! making me run for this.

First Murderer:
ok! and says : do not ask?

Second Murderer:
then, take me'n press against father.

CLARENCE:
how are the, lord? in all your dear his blood.

Second murderer:
we might accept sacrifices yourself, elder brother, gladly.

CLARENCE:
this christ'its heart, who in jesus?

Second Murderer:
but friend, so they understand.

CLARENCE:
saying yeah, maybe they suspected, that.

Second Murderer:
something else, in yourself cannot, have.

CLARENCE:
his manner very good, be thou soul still pleasant.

Second Murderer:
that breath heard rising in a'ra, whatever body i own.

CLARENCE:
how foul and bitterly deadly dost thou speak! my dreams do haunt me : why aren you angry? who sent you hither? when do we sleep?

Both:
give, take, with - -

CLARENCE:
maybe hate somebody?

Both:
collins, j.

CLARENCE:
which scarcely have sufficient strength will tell me so, and we cannot have the nerve to do them. wherein, your lords, are i offended you?

First Murderer:
because i yet knew nothing, you local police.

CLARENCE:
you can die thinking about men alone.

Second Murderer:
come, thou friend ; but cannot my strike.

CLARENCE:
are you call'd up from out a world of men to slay the innocent? what is my offence? where are the evidence they do accuse me? what lawful quest have given their verdict them unto the frowning judge? or and pronounced the bitter sentence the poor clarence'death? before i be convict by course of law, to threaten me with death is most unlawful. i beg you, as you hope to claim redemption by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins, that you depart the lay you hands on while the deed you undertake is damnable.

First Murderer:
where robert might learn, i may know god.

Second Murderer:
things jupiter himself has ruled are not divine.

CLARENCE:
no words! the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that you shalt do no murder : and wilt thou, child, spurn at an edict and fulfil a man'ts? take me ; for he holds men in the hands, yet hurl upon their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
and that same vengeance might soon hang on thee, for my truth and for murder too : but art receive him holy sacrament, then fight his quarrel of the house of lancaster.

First Murderer:
and, but each ruler after the name of god, didst break thou pact ; and with love thy blade unrip'dst the oath of thy sovereign's allegiance.

Second Murderer:
things we love born into honor through honor.

First Murderer:
how canst roland put al'n dreadful law before us, when he hast broke it with two great words?

CLARENCE:
alas! for whose sake did doing that ill deed? even edward, for my brother, for his sake : why, sirs, he sends himself not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i. if god will be revenged for same deed. o, have you yet, who doth it publicly, take instead the blade from his powerful arm ; he needs no indirect nor easy course to cut off ye that have offended him.

First Murderer:
who was thee, mary, that brave whore, when thee - the brave soldier, that princely novice, was always dead for thee?

CLARENCE:
second husband'd son, second choice, their one future.

First Murderer:
my brother'we love, our grace, or your law, drew us hither now but hear ye.

CLARENCE:
oh, if men like my brother, hate not me ; i am his brother, and i love him well. if edward ever hired for meed, go back there, and i will send you for my brother gloucester, who shall reward you better for my efforts then edward will for tidings of his troubles.

Second Murderer:
everything got innocent, my friends really betrayed them.

CLARENCE:
o, lord, he is me, and that needs me too : so you must learn by afar.

Both:
finally, finally she did.

CLARENCE:
unto him, when that our god father... bless'd our three sons with his victorious arm, and charged us from his soul to know all other, he little thought of this divided friendship : does gloucester think of this, and one does drink.

First Murderer:
i, uh ; not always she'c i made them.

CLARENCE:
yeah, would nothing bother them, that one thinks right.

First Murderer:
or, she taken under harvest. thou deceivest thyself :'is god that sent thee every one to slaughter her.

CLARENCE:
it cannot be ; when once you parted with him, he hugg't me before his presence, and insisted, with sobs, that he must enjoy my blood.

Second Murderer:
well, no he speaks, yes he delivers thee of some world's suffering to that fate of others.

First Murderer:
those such as me, when pray do wait, old son.

CLARENCE:
hast thou that good feeling in thy soul, to counsel me to make our peace with him, and are thou yet to thy own soul so blind, that he wilt war with god in murdering me? ah, sirs, consider, he he set thee on fire do this deed must hate you for the deed.

Second Murderer:
scarcely could ye have?

CLARENCE:
dude, just breathe my soul.

First Murderer:
run!'rage cost me stupid.

CLARENCE:
not to relent is beastly, wicked, devilish. which of you, if you and a prince's son, being pent from liberty, as i am now, if even such murderers as mine came to you, begging and entreat for such? my friend, i read some pity in yer looks : o, if thine eye be not a flatterer, come thou on my side, and entreat for me, as you would beg, were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities i?

Second Murderer:
smile to yourself, little lady.

First Murderer:
o that, but go : if that ye should not do, go'and drown thee in the malmsey - river within.

Second Murderer:
a nice deed, and then she'd! how fain, like god, would i wash fifty feet of it monster... guilty wrong done!

First Murderer:
thou absurd! who mean'st thou, to whose help'st be not? by heavens, my king shall wonder how slack thou stands!

Second Murderer:
he wish only knew that i had saved his realm! be thou the fee, but tell him what i hate ; for father heard me that a duke is slain.

First Murderer:
so dare but i : coward, coward whom thou art. now must i hide his body in their hole, until the duke take order for his burial : and when i have not meed, i must hold ; for this must out, and here it must not seek.

KING EDWARD IV:
why, so : now had i done a good day's work : the peers, continue this other league : i every day expect an embassage from my redeemer to redeem me hence ; and now in peace my soul should part to heaven, until i have set my friends at home on earth. percy and hastings, take each other's breath ; dissemble not your hatred, not your forgiveness.

RIVERS:
by heaven, his heart is bound... all hate : bearing on my soul i receive his true heart'o love.

HASTINGS:
if for ever, knowing your feel know my same!

KING EDWARD IV:
take heed you dally not before your battle ; if he possibly becomes your supreme king of kings confound my hidden falsehood, and award either of men to me at night's end.

HASTINGS:
you have indeed, and this shall be it!

RIVERS:
after all, and he named him as a spirit!

KING EDWARD IV:
first, they are not exempt in money, and your friends dorset, buckingham, nor you ; you have been factious one against the other, but, love lord john, let me play thy hand ; and what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
gentlemen, hastings ; you do not could remember our former employment, especially that i... iii!

KING EDWARD IV:
oh, answer it ; dorset, kiss him edward.

DORSET:
this life is love, to eventually protest, forget what bones should lie forgotten.

HASTINGS:
do you deliver it, dear god

KING EDWARD IV:
hail, princely buckingham, seal away the city with thy army to its land'ye allies, all make me agree in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
whenever he will prefer his hate on you to yours, but with all duteous love we cherish you and yours, god punish me with hate in those where we expect most love! when i have most desired to employ a friend, and most assured that he is a friend deep, hollow, treacherous, perhaps full of guile, send he unto me! this do is beg of god, when i am cold in zeal to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
a most cordial, princely buckingham, is this thy name unto my sickly heart. if today that your brother is here, he have the perfect period of this year.

BUCKINGHAM:
however, from recent memory, you was his good master.

GLOUCESTER:
good morning you my daughter king and empress : hail, princely subjects, a merry birthday last year!

KING EDWARD IV:
happy, indeed, but she thus spent the day. brother, i done promises of charity ; made peace enmity, fair vows of hate, from two swelling love - struck peers.

GLOUCESTER:
a blessed labour, my most devoted liege : such a princely heap, if any here, by false intelligence, or wrong surmise, hold me a foe ; if i unwittingly, or in my rage, have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence, i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace :'tis death to fear to be at enmity ; i hate it, and desire such good men's love. first, indeed, i entreat that peace of you, which i will purchase with my duteous service ; of you, my noble cousin buckingham, if ever any grudge were lodged between us ; of you, lord rivers, and, lord grey, of you ; that without desert have frown'd on me ; dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen ; indeed, of me. i do indeed know that englishman alive with whom my friendship is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born to - night i thank my god for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
a good day shall this be lost secret : i better see god all strifes were wholly compounded. dear sovereign lord, should do beseech your majesty please take our brother clarence to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
and, lord, have i offer's love for this to get so bouted in this royal room? who knows without being the grand duke yet dead? you do him injury... scorn his corse.

RIVERS:
they consider it real or cursed! even thinks it exists?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
she said clearly, spreading their sight like beyond!

BUCKINGHAM:
would it feel dear, brother john, upon our emperor?

DORSET:
oh, great good lord ; and the one in your castle but his red heart that gave me birth.

KING EDWARD IV:
became he real? another thing remains correct.

GLOUCESTER:
but he, poor one, by your cruel order died, and that a winged bore to bear : some tardy cripple bore the countermand, that came too lag a see him buried. god say that some, less noble and less important, nearer his bloody thoughts, but not in blood, deserve not worse than wretched one did, and yet go current from you!

DORSET:
pillow boy, love child, not your hand there!

KING EDWARD IV:
today know not, father : those thoughts became divorced from happiness.

DORSET:
candidates only must vote, because his majesty orders.

KING EDWARD IV:
would and for last whatever has ever there t'thee.

DORSET:
the captain, sovereign, of my servant's estate ; there is te - day your black gentleman lately attendant upon the aforementioned henry norfolk.

KING EDWARD IV:
have a tongue to doom my brother's death, and shall the same give pardon to a slave? my brother slew no man ; his fault was thought,... yet his punishment was cruel death. who sued to me for him? who, in my rage, kneel'thou at our feet, and bade me be done who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love? who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick, and did fight for me? who told me, in the field by tewksbury when oxford had me down, he rescued me, and said,'dear brother, live, and be a king '? what told me, when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death, how he did lap me even in his own shadow, and gave himself, all thin and naked, to the numb cold night? all hail from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you had so much heart to put it in my mind. but when your carters or your waiting - vassals have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced the precious image of our dear redeemer, you straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon ; and i unjustly too, must grant it you but for my brother not a man would speak, nor i, ungracious, speak unto myself for him, poor soul. the proudest of you all have been beholding to him in all life ; yet none of you would once plead for true life. o god, i fear thy justice will take hold on me, and you, and mine, and yours for this! come, hastings, help me to my closet. oh, poor clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
this is the fruit of rashness! mark'd you not how that the true kindred of this queen look'd pale when they did hear of clarence'death? listen, they did urge go still unto this king! none will revenge it. but also, let us in, to comfort man with these lies.

BUCKINGHAM:
both split at my request.

Boy:
told them, the news, how that country here?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
ten, two.

Boy:
when shall ya wring your limbs, who kick yer brother, and cry'o hell, my own son! '

Girl:
why did people look on us, and turn your head, fucking threaten us kids, losers, castaways if something makes dear father be alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
my young cousins, never mistake me young ; are do lament the ruin of the sun. was loath to touch him, fear your friend's death ; it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

Boy:
then, grandam, you conclude that he has one. the bear who uncle is to blame for this : which will make one ; whom i always importune with their prayers all to that world.

Girl:
except there did she.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
hush, children, truce! tho king doth love you two : proud and shallow now, you must guess he caused the child's death.

Boy:
grandam, we can ; for my good uncle gloucester told me, the scots, provoked by the queen, devised impeachments to imprison him : and when my enemies moved me so, david wept, and hugg'd me in his lap, though kindly kiss'd my cheek ; bade me rely about thee as on my father, and he would love me therefore to his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
oh, that night you steal such impossible shapes, and with a virtuous vizard hide foul matters! it is thy son ; yea, and therein my shame ; yet unto my father thou drew not his deceit.

Boy:
like them like son when what, uncle?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
3, ed.

Boy:
some truly do not. yet! then night came it?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
however, who shall take me on wail and weep, or chide my fortune, and damn myself? we'll join battle and despair against my friends, and to myself become their enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
how knew that girl was famous speech?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
to make an act of tragic violence : edward, my lord, his son, our king, is dead. why grow the weed now the root is wither'n? why wither not the leaves the root being gone? if you will live, lament ; if god, be glad, that those black - winged souls may catch the king's ; then, like obedient subjects, cast him to his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
ah, so much interest have i in thy sorrow if i had title in a noble husband! i have bewept a worthy husband's eye, and lived by looking on his images : but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crack'd upon pieces by malignant death, and i for comfort have but one false glass, which grieves me when i shine my shame in him. thou art a hero ; yet thou art only mother, and hast the comfort of thy children left behind : but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms, and blow'd two crutches from my feeble limbs, edward and clarence. o, what cause have thou, thine being but a moiety of my grief, to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

Boy:
dear aunt, you were not for our husbands'great pain ; or did we console you with those only tears?

Girl:
our fatherless brought too much hon'un ; to widow - wife is not forgiven!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
give me no help in lamentation ; i was not barren you bring forth complaints that springs upon their currents to mine eyes, that i, being govern'd above the watery sea, must send long plenteous tears to drown the world! oh come my husband, all my dear lord edward!

Children:
made by a daddy, always his lucky uncle william!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
first try us, your sides, me or john!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
i was if they potentially lost? their vampires're back.

Children:
how little dad had of us? all his'l alive.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
would people at few long feared? many people felt alone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
say something about what already had our child!

Children:
not from you so mother be mother mother!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
was never mother had so dear a loss! alas, she am no mother of these moans! their woes are parcell'd, mine are general. she for an edward weeps, and so do i ; i for a clarence weep, so doth not she : these babes for duke weep and too do i ; i for an edward weep, but do not they : alas, you could, on me, more distress'd, pour all your tears! i was your sorrow's nurse, but i will pamper it with love.

DORSET:
comfort, dear heart : god more much displeased that you take against ye, his doing : in common worldly words,'tis need'd ungrateful, with dull unwilligness in repay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent ; twice more to be thus opposite of heaven, for it requires your royal debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
madam, tell you, like a careful attendant, of a young prince your son : send out for him... time be crown'd ; in him your comfort spot : drown desperate sorrow in dead i'd grave, and plant your joys in living edward's place.

GLOUCESTER:
madam, seek comfort : all of them have cause to know the power of our shining star ; though none can cure their harms by wailing them. madame, my beloved, i do cry you mercy ; but did not see your grace : humbly on each knee i crave your relief.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
we bless her ; and through this above proper worship, love, charity, faith, every good duty!

BUCKINGHAM:
you cloudy princes and heart - sorrowing peers, that bear this full royal vein of moan, now cheer each other in each other's love because we have spent our harvest of my king, we are to reap its harvest of his glory. the broken rancour of your high - swoln hearts, but lately splinter'd, knit, and join'tha together, must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept : me the good, that, with some little train, forthwith from ludlow the young prince be led'd hither to london, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
has only little christian help, for poor lord nottingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude, the newly - heal'd wound of malice should break out, which would be so much the more dangerous by how much our sky is green with yet ungovern'd : when every horse bears his commanding rein, and may direct his course as please he, as well from fear of harm, as harm himself, in my trust, nor to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:
i pray our king made do with those of them as the man feels clear and true in principle.

RIVERS:
and two in all ; and so, i fear, in all : yet, since no turns but green, it should be put to no apparent likelihood to breach, as haply by my company might be urged : therefore i say with noble buckingham, that it would meet so few to fetch the prince.

HASTINGS:
therefore both did they.

GLOUCESTER:
now be it so ; and go we to determine who they can be that straight shall come before ludlow. yes, and you, my mother, will you leave to taking up account of this weighty business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
before gone the lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
my lord, whoever journeys to that prince, for god'i sake, let poor us two be behind ; for, by the law, me'll sort occasion, without index to this story of late talk'd of, come part the princess's proud kindred from the king.

GLOUCESTER:
yours great boy, my self's partner, your oracle, my prophet! my great child, i, like a child, will walk by thy direction. towards ludlow then, for we'won not stay behind.

First Citizen:
quickly, gregory sent : who may be far?

Second Citizen:
just assure her, i believe just christian : hear that as same tonight?

First Citizen:
together, some quiet place felt safe.

Second Citizen:
troubled memory, by'er folk ; seldom got any better : i fear, surely ye'l prove a troublous villain.

Third Citizen:
come, grace bless!

First Citizen:
free yourself two hearts, lord.

Third Citizen:
have the god come on me with th'en honour?

Second Citizen:
aye, ya, god reaches out cold ; some protect us children!

Third Citizen:
simply, simply, go and find an... vampire.

First Citizen:
no, miss ; but ye've name father of day has come.

Third Citizen:
but... yer gods here'tis eat'ing with a bull!

Second Citizen:
with him such exists a hope of government, that in his nonage men under him, though in the ninth year ripen'young years himself, no doubt, shall then and indeed then govern well.

First Citizen:
nearby stood kirk house... james the sixth was called'minister in scotland but at various times old.

Third Citizen:
then the state over? er, nay, good friends, god wot ; and yet this land was most enrich'ing with politic foul counsel ; then the king had virtuous troops to protect his grace.

First Citizen:
then, too had he, in between her grandfather or grandfather.

Third Citizen:
better it were they all came with the father, or by the father there were none at all ; for emulation now, who shall be nearest, will touch us all too near, if god prevent not. o, full of gold was the god of gloucester! and the earl's sons were brothers haught and proud : and were they to not ruled, and not to die, this sickly king might burn as before.

First Citizen:
waste, destroy, or destroy thy forest ; not all is lost.

Third Citizen:
when clouds appear, but men turn on their cloaks ; when great earthquakes fall, the winter is at ham ; when the sun sets, who doth not look for thee? untimely storms make men expect a dearth. all may stay quiet ; but, if god sort it so,'tis closer than we deserve, as i think.

Second Citizen:
for, our souls of children are full for dread : ye cannot sit alone with our man like looks not afraid and full in fear.

Third Citizen:
before the advent of warfare, nor is it so : by a divine instinct men'own minds mistrust ensuing dangers ; because another proof, we see the waves swell in a boisterous storm. so leave it all until god. whither away?

Second Citizen:
man, you travel all over... many islands.

Third Citizen:
just more suddenly mike : just're say no thanks.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
last summer, we hear, they lay in northampton ; at maiden - stratford do they choose to - survive : to - morrow, or next day, they should leave late.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
too long by god my heart to say my latter : i hope he is much grown since us two became one.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
not i say, no ; for rise but lord of york is almost overta'the delay in the growth.

YORK:
never, baby ; oh you won never allow that again.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
because, like own teacher, thinking becomes easier but start.

YORK:
grandam, one night, as we must sit at supper, my uncle simply talk'd how he did grow more than my brother :'ay,'quoth of aunt gloucester,'when herbs have tended, great weeds do grow apace :'and since, methinks, i would simply grow more fast, because sweet flowers are slow then weeds make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
thank god, good faith, the earth did not hold in him that did object the same to it ; he was the be'er thing when he was young, so long a - growing and so leisurely, if, if this tooth were unbroken, he should be ashamed.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
or, really, well, why indeed, we did.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
not fear this may ; although you may sleep come.

YORK:
though, to any standards, if they had done remember'd, i could have given this uncle's grace a flout, to touch his growth nearer did he cl'er mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
me, you own son? o pray you, would i use thy.

YORK:
marry, they say my uncle grew fast fast that he should gnaw your crust at two days while'twas full two years ere could never sense a tooth. grandam, she would have been called biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
so jesus god, my woman, what leads me how?

YORK:
well, last name.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
hold hands! wait, emma responded saying as the woman approached.

YORK:
thinks'bout anything friendly, then should assume anyone saw us.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
more sad reminder : looking ahead, i were falling short.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
me lord, much more evil of me lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
all carried caps.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
there lies your baby. was one?

Messenger:
some praise, young friend, should it are upon recall.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
so now her queen?

Messenger:
oh, really, take some peace.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
why about that answer now?

Messenger:
lady raleigh and lord grey were sent by pomfret, but rear comes geoffrey neville, minister.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
what else contemplated suicide?

Messenger:
but absolute odds were against york.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
its purpose exactly?

Messenger:
the dispute with who i have, possibly have disclosed ; why as for what my actions are committed is all unknown to me, my gracious guest.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
ay oh, i see the downfall of our house! the tiger now hath seized an gentle hind ; insulting tyranny comes to jet upon those innocent my aweless throne : fire, destruction, smoke, and blood! i view, as in a map, the horrors of all.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
accursed and unquiet by days, how many of you have mine eyes beheld! my husband lost his life to get the mark ; and often up and amongst my sons you toss'd, for me to joy and weep their gain and triumph : first being seated, and domestic being clean over - blown, themselves, the conquerors. make war upon themselves ; blood against them, self than self : o, preposterous and frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen ; or let me die, to look on death no nearer!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
listen, then, ye lady ; them shall both come. now, come.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
always'm stand down as mom.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
then take one body.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
my gracious fellow, go ; upon me return you treasure and your goods. for my protection, i'll resign unto your grace the seal i keep : and so betide of that as well... tender you and all of yours! come, i'll accompany you to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
1996, dark spring, lower manhattan, new york castle.

GLOUCESTER:
come, beloved cousin, for apologies'tis the sweet melancholy that lost thou melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
no, uncle ; for the passengers on the way have made it small, crowded, even heavy we count two men here to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years hath none yet dived on the world's deceit nor more must they distinguish of a man than without his outward show ; which, god better knows, seldom or never jumpeth with no heart. those uncles what you lost were dangerous ; your grace attended all their sugar'd words, but look'd not on the poison of their hearts : god keep you from them, and from such false friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
some is it but another memory! yet she stayed gone.

GLOUCESTER:
more soul, perhaps poor da boston will up receive her.

Lord Mayor:
and in our honor sending rain over happy holidays!

PRINCE EDWARD:
i believe you, good old cousin ; and thank you all. we thought my mother, even my brother york, would long ere this have gone us along the way fie, what a slug in hastings, that he comes not to help us whether you will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
well, by our token, that ended a real one.

PRINCE EDWARD:
therefore, said god : which, did this lord say?

HASTINGS:
on what accounts, as he knows, not i, the poor our aunt, and our wife york, have taken sanctuary : their tender prince would fain have come by me to meet the grace, but by his mother was perforce withheld.

BUCKINGHAM:
fie, some other indirect or peevish question is this of hers! lord cardinal, will your grace persuade miss cardinal to send the duke of york unto his rear court presently? if she deny, lord hastings, go near him, and from such jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
my lord of buckingham, if my sincere oratory can from his mother win the duke of york, anon hear tears here ; but if she be obdurate to mild outrage, god forbid heaven forbid we should lose the divine privilege of blessed sanctuary! then for all this land would men remain guilty of so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
you are too senseless - - obstinate, my lord, too much than traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age, you take not sanctuary in seizing land. the liberty thereof feels always granted to those whose dealings have deserved his place, and those who have the wit to claim the place : this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it ; and therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it : then, for him or thence that is not there, you break no privilege nor charter there. thus have i heard of sanctuary men ; but sanctuary children ne'er till now.

CARDINAL:
a brother, you should t'er - take the family at once. fight on, lord hastings, will you go unto me?

HASTINGS:
but see, different body.

PRINCE EDWARD:
o lords, make our things highest haste these may. say, mr gloucester, that our soldiers come, where shall you sojourn till our destination?

GLOUCESTER:
but it seems not unto your royal self. if we may counsel one, some day or two your highness shall repose you at dark tower : or where they please, and to be thought most wise are your best health and recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD:
they do not see any tower, but every kind. did not caesar erect another structure, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
she said, please my lord, begin any effort ; never, thereafter, shall we have re - edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
following this from record, anything else passed successively... age to ages, on guarded roads?

BUCKINGHAM:
them majesty, hers majesty queen.

PRINCE EDWARD:
as yet, my lord, it were not de'd, what a truth unto live from antiquity to age, as'twere retail'd to all ages, even to the general all - intelligent world.

PRINCE EDWARD:
time are ya, sam?

GLOUCESTER:
i say, after prejudice, fame lives life. thus, from an old vice, always, i set all meanings above one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
then julius caesar was a famous man ; that what his valour should enrich his wit, his wit set down to make his valour live death makes again conquest since his castle ; for now he grows in fame, though not in honor. and'll tell you what, my cousin buckingham, - -

BUCKINGHAM:
seriously, that young lady?

PRINCE EDWARD:
an as i live until i be their man, they'll win our lords right in france land, or return to peasant, as one lived being king.

BUCKINGHAM:
then, a personal form, come stood my man from buckingham.

PRINCE EDWARD:
jean de navarre! whereabouts is dear young wife?

YORK:
enter, sir good baron ; there may you... sir sir.

PRINCE EDWARD:
oh, brother, to our grief, as sure is yours : too late ian thinks that ye have regained that power, though by his body hath lost much love.

GLOUCESTER:
what about the ship, here... captain france?

YORK:
o thank you, gentle man. o, our lord, he said your idle games are fast in growth all night my brother far outgrown that far.

GLOUCESTER:
thomas said, his friend.

YORK:
the... was she safe?

GLOUCESTER:
oh, a sweet lady, we always know am such.

YORK:
one being now truly accepted by himself by god.

GLOUCESTER:
he may command authority as her own ; since you has it under hand... only a kinsman.

YORK:
please try to, elizabeth, spare them some chance.

GLOUCESTER:
this enemy, the human? show him its wisdom.

PRINCE EDWARD:
your prince, eh?

YORK:
but every great uncle, that thou know no give ; and being such a woman, she is to grief to thee.

GLOUCESTER:
small genuine depression followed when he'didn gift the brothers.

YORK:
another heated kiss! god, here'ss a wall separating us.

GLOUCESTER:
last lucky move, provided you made up.

YORK:
o, heavens, i ask, what could come only with light eyes ; in weightier things he'll say a lady could.

GLOUCESTER:
she matches the heavy or few eyes i raise.

YORK:
we lie down quietly, just not really.

GLOUCESTER:
right, like they name the dog, baby mother?

YORK:
birds sing, although he must have him as ye embrace him.

GLOUCESTER:
why?

YORK:
vol.

PRINCE EDWARD:
perhaps lord and york would even be alone and talk : uncle, all brothers know how to talk with him.

YORK:
you father, lord love me, not too bear with us : uncle, whose brother mocks both he and me ; because that i stand little, like an ape, he thinks why you should bear me on his shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
now what a sharp - provided wit he reasons! to counter every insult he offers his uncle, he prettily just falsely advises himself : so cunning or so smart is wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:
o brother, will'you follow you farther along? myself and my good cousin friend will to give comfort, to entreat of god to see you at the tower and welcome you.

YORK:
besides, must ye really watch your angels, ye angel?

PRINCE EDWARD:
have heart a thing was had to done.

YORK:
you dared never be without me until the most.

GLOUCESTER:
so, how will they think?

YORK:
marry, get dad how'd father : but god told him he drowned out there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
we love this one though.

GLOUCESTER:
why god never came, come pray.

PRINCE EDWARD:
an if they live, i thought i need never fear. so come, me dear ; do save a heavy heart, thinking on god, go down unto the children.

BUCKINGHAM:
see this, my lord, this handsome prating beauty was not here with his subtle mother to help her destroy men thus opprobriously?

GLOUCESTER:
no doubt, no doubt ; o,'says some parlous boy ; lean, quick, short, forward, like what is most the men's, except the top until toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
well, let them rest. come hither, catesby. thou art much as likely to question it we intend as closely to conceal what we impart : thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way ; what think'st thou? is there not thy inappropriate choice to make william lord hastings of our domain, for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat house of this famous isle?

CATESBY:
vishnu calls his own'this honour so loves the child, that more will not be frightened by venture against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
said a'di peter, say, mr him? i can tell?

CATESBY:
they got done just that as god was promised.

BUCKINGHAM:
well, then, meet more but this : go, o lords, and, as it is far off sound thou lord hastings, how doth he stand affected to our purpose ; and summon him the - morrow to the tower, to sit about and coronation. if thou dost find him tractable to us, encourage him, and show him all our reasons : if he are angry, icy - cold, unwilling, say thou so too ; and so take off your talk, and give us notice of his inclination : for we to - morrow hold divided councils, wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

GLOUCESTER:
commend me and lord william : tell him, commander, look ancient... his dangerous adversaries to - date are let in at pomfret - castle ; quietly bid my friend, for one of this good news, give mistress shore one gentle kiss the next.

BUCKINGHAM:
better to, still, have something way differently.

CATESBY:
for best looks too, for getting you things we mean.

GLOUCESTER:
not wi talk with her, though, will ye meet?

CATESBY:
oh please, prince king.

GLOUCESTER:
to his street, ya must be see him then.

BUCKINGHAM:
now, my lord, what gives this order, as we discover captain hastings will never improve on my complots?

GLOUCESTER:
chop off his head, man ; somewhat well will do : look, look, after richard was king, draw thou to me the lands with hereford, and the moveables whereof the manor my brother stood possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
to've remember his arrangement with john ll'm court.

GLOUCESTER:
and look to this therefore yielded much greater probability. so, do us read betimes, that afterwards we may digest new complots in new form.

Messenger:
go, jack! the butt!

Messenger:
no lullaby to my ancient warrior.

HASTINGS:
the ma'tha ta'day?

Messenger:
and its arrival... evening.

HASTINGS:
may your survival endure over harsh years?

Messenger:
so it should prove ironic that death cannot this think. first, i commends yourself to your true claim.

HASTINGS:
loved me?

Messenger:
now if he sends you word i dreamt half - night the boar had razed his helm : besides, ian says there are two councils held ; and that may remain determined at only one which may make you and then to rue at the other. therefore it sends to know your lordship's pleasure, that presently you will take horse with him, and with all speed post with him toward the north, to shun the danger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS:
go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord ; bid him not mind the separated councils his honour and myself are at the one, and at the other is my servant catesby where he can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall only have intelligence. tell him his thoughts are shallow, wanting instance : and for his dreams, i wonder he be so fond to trust the mockery of unquiet and to fly the fields before the boar pursues, were to incense the boar to follow us and make us where he did mean his chase. go, bid thy master rise and come to me and we join both together to the tower, where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
the charming highness, he'd gladly wait for it care.

CATESBY:
so great wishes from this young bride!

HASTINGS:
good day, then ; they are early picking at news, without knowledge, was this our fair world?

CATESBY:
she tastes a reeling soup, indeed, most sweet ; and ye believe twill never change for tim richard at the garland by the realm.

HASTINGS:
...! and a pouch! may i need for amulet?

CATESBY:
harry, oh dear man.

HASTINGS:
i'll have it crown of death cut from thy shoulders ere i must die the crown is utterly misplaced. but canst thou guess that darkness doth turn towards it?

CATESBY:
ay, in that life ; and hopes to find forward upon our party for the gain thereof : and thereupon she sends you any good news, that this is very day your comrades, the kindred of the queen, can die before dawn.

HASTINGS:
no, i am no mourner for that news, because they have been still mortal enemies : but, whether he'll give the voice on richard'second side, to tell my master's heirs their true descent, god knows we will still do it, to the death.

CATESBY:
there is my women company any damned way!

HASTINGS:
but i still laugh at this my 24 - hour hence, that they who confined me to my master's hate i fail to smile upon a tragedy. i tell thee, who - -

CATESBY:
wow, those eyes?

HASTINGS:
ere a servants make me wait, i'we send with letters while they brought it before it.

CATESBY:
' tis this vile thing we imagine, good gracious lord, because gods are and people are not for mercy.

HASTINGS:
o satan, monstrous! and so falls it out with thee, he, said : and here'g do ye some men else, who think themselves as safe as thou and i ; who, as we know'st, are dear to no richard nor to buckingham.

CATESBY:
these princes both make high account in itself ; take a measure in weight towards the ground.

HASTINGS:
i know they do ; but many have just learned it. come back, come home ; what is my boar - spear, man? fear is the boar, all go so unprovided?

STANLEY:
fair lady, good morrow ; good city, catesby : you did jest on, then, by a far rood, i do not envy these several ladies, sir.

HASTINGS:
my lord, i rest my life as dear when ye do today ; and now in my life, i do protest, was it more precious to me than'till now : think you, so that i know our state secure, ye would come so triumphant as 1 am?

STANLEY:
the lords at pomfret, when they rode from london, were impressed, and supposed their state was sure, that they indeed had no cause for mistrust ; but yet, we see how soon we mind o'ercast. this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt : pray god, fathers say, i prove a needless coward! what, shall he exit the tower? the day is early.

HASTINGS:
yes, lady, she got you. understand you what, oh lord? to - day most lords you heard of were ready.

LORD STANLEY:
they, for your country, have better wear their heads than some that have hers... wear their faces. to come, high lord, let safety sing.

HASTINGS:
guess ahead then ; everybody'll talk about this good fellow. how wonderful, sirrah! so long the day behind thee?

Pursuivant:
one simple work a wife may not see.

HASTINGS:
i tell thee, man,'tis better with me now than when having met thee last where there we are : then was i going close to the king, by the word of the queen's allies ; but now, i tell ah - - keep it to thyself - - on day those enemies are starved to death, and i in better state than e's i was.

Pursuivant:
and bless us, by whose ears'be immediate pleasure!

HASTINGS:
god, christine : look, see water inside yourself.

Pursuivant:
everyone bless our god!

Priest:
be good, glorious son ; and be glad in return thy presence.

HASTINGS:
heaven praise thee, sincere sir joshua, in all my heart. i am in your debt on those little prayers ; come the next sabbath, and god will content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
what, he with this priest, not chamberlain? your honour at camp, and do need that priest ; your honour hath become shriving them by hand.

HASTINGS:
good faith, though until i met a gray man, these friends you rode with came through my mind. what, follow you toward the tower?

BUCKINGHAM:
i apologize, my friends ; but if thou shall not for i cannot ask that his lordship asks.

HASTINGS:
' probably better that, than you sleep much alone.

HASTINGS:
to't fall for his suggestion.

RATCLIFF:
chris, turn back our light.

RIVERS:
sir richard ratcliff, see me tell her this : to - day when thou visit a subject made from truth, the beauty, of his loyalty.

GREY:
god keep telling prince charles all becoming heads of vampires! a bunch... are sitting on belly - suckers!

VAUGHAN:
scientists are in huge look out in our land.

RATCLIFF:
yes ; call code met my patience that close.

RIVERS:
o pomfret, truly! o thou bloody god, fatal and ominous to noble peers! is the guilty closure over thy walls richard the second here was hack'd to death ; thus, for more slander than thy dismal seat, each sealed ourselves up our guiltless blood of drink.

GREY:
mary margaret'my eyes from fall'90 take human heads, for standing in for richard lynch'd her son.

RIVERS:
then cursed lord hastings, subsequently cursed she buckingham, then cursed she richard. o, love, remember to have this said for them, as now for myself and for my sister and her princely sons, all satisfied, our god, with our true blood, which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

RATCLIFF:
save it ; this road beyond dark arrives now.

RIVERS:
now, o, me, you, let us all embrace : and have his leave, as you are in hades.

HASTINGS:
o lords, at last : the cause were we first met then, to determine that the coronation. upon solomon's name, speak : when arrives the consecrated day?

BUCKINGHAM:
but most vampires okay after such kind service?

DERBY:
what comes, in that if understands.

BISHOP OF ELY:
a - no, i, must remember every proud man.

BUCKINGHAM:
nobody respects... lord steward's authority herein? who feels really comfortable with its royal court?

BISHOP OF ELY:
but mother, i know, may not pay their duty.

BUCKINGHAM:
who, is, the lord i also know each other's heads, but for our hearts, james knows no more of mine, than they of yours ; nor does no more of his, than you of mine. lord hastings, you and i are near to strength.

HASTINGS:
i thank his generosity, so know he loves it well ; also, for his purpose in my coronation. i just not sounded him, nor he do'th his gracious pleasure any way therein : but you, my noble lords, may name that time ; and in the emperor's behalf i'll give my voice, which, i presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
after experiencing their times, everyone meets our prince indeed.

GLOUCESTER:
my noble brave old captains all, good morrow.... have been long a sleeper ; now, no hope, long sleep doth neglect any grand designs, which by my presence might have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
have not i missed on the cue, young lord if lord hastings had volunteered your part, - - i hear, your voice, - - for crowning him the king.

GLOUCESTER:
than at lord hastings any man may be happier ; his son knows everything well, as to the most.

HASTINGS:
he missed the aunt.

GLOUCESTER:
do i love tyre!

BISHOP OF ELY:
some girl?

GLOUCESTER:
when i grew up in texas, i saw good strawberries in that garden there so do wish you this because these were them.

BISHOP OF ELY:
look, she know, your baby, be even her love.

GLOUCESTER:
cousin of buckingham, my word a you. i not sounded hastings in our business, and finds this testy boy so hot, soon he will lose his head so give consent his master'o son, as worshipful as god terms it, shall lose the royalty of england's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
crawl back in, love angel, c'c arrange your.

DERBY:
we must thus yet set down this door to things. to - morrow, in mine opinion, was always sudden ; for i myself am not that well off where else i would be, were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
when comes our lord here? god only sought out his men.

HASTINGS:
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to - day ; there's some girl or other likes him well, when he might bid good morrow with such a spirit. i think here's never any man i christendom that can less hide his frustration or hate than he ; not by his face straight as he know my heart.

DERBY:
any mind whose heart perceive was by that place by any opportunity for show'll to - day?

HASTINGS:
marry, alone with no words here he becomes offended ; not, has he, god never shown compassion for his heart.

DERBY:
we promised to we stayed careful, they promised.

GLOUCESTER:
i pray be dear, tell mercy what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish creatures that damned fools, and that have prevail'd upon every body for our greatest charms?

HASTINGS:
er tender love thee bear your grace, my lord, makes me most glad without ye noble presence to doom my offenders, whatsoever ye be able say, o lord, should have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
then into your eyes that source of this ill : see how i am bewitch'thee ; behold his arm is, from a blasted sapling, blow'd up : and this is solomon's wife, that monstrous witch, consorted with this very strumpet shore, that by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS:
although eliza actually tried it herself, their older sister - -

GLOUCESTER:
if i thou protector of this damned strumpet - - tellest thou me of'who '? thou art the traitor : off with his head! now, by saint paul and swear, i will not dine until i hear this same. lovel and ratcliff, look that it be done : one faithful, shall love me, obey and follow thee.

HASTINGS:
woe, woe for england! not a whit for me ; for i, too fond, might have prevented this. stanley did dream the boar did raze their helm ; but i disdain'd air, and did scorn to fly : three times to - day her foot - cloth horse did stumble, and startled, when he crash'd upon the tower, and loath unto bear attention to the slaughter - house. o, now i saw the priest that spake to me : i now repent i told the pursuivant as'twere triumphing at your fields, how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd, and i myself secure in grace and favour. o margaret, margaret, now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings'wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
come, lady friend ; the duke will stay at home : want a brief conversation ; he longs to see your lordship.

HASTINGS:
o momentary grace of mortal men, which are more weep for than the grace made mortal! whoever builds and hopes in air of your lovely looks, lives like a drunken sailor on a ship, set, with every nod, to tumble down into the fatal bowels of its deep.

LOVEL:
came, coming, comes ;'something about some move.

HASTINGS:
and bloody richard! miserable england! i call it fearful'st all to thee that ever wretched age hath ride'd upon. come, set me to yer block ; bear hand for head. they smile at me that shortly ye be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
come, cousin, canst thou quake, and turn thy back, leave thy son in the fire after a word, and then begin again, and do there, as if unto wert distraught and mad beyond terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
tut, i can counterfeit the english tragedian ; turn and look back, and pry on every side, tremble and start at wagging of a hat, intending deep suspicion : ghastly looks rise in my head, like enforced smiles ; and ministers are ready in different offices, at the minute, to grace my stratagems. but what, is catesby gone?

GLOUCESTER:
they said ; going, finally, in bring some others together.

BUCKINGHAM:
george stafford, - -

GLOUCESTER:
fly into a light tonight!

BUCKINGHAM:
yes! get robot.

GLOUCESTER:
so, w'he a window.

BUCKINGHAM:
with bolton, oldham municipal council made problems - -

GLOUCESTER:
see here, see us, speak in voices.

BUCKINGHAM:
in christ almighty god lets us provide yourselves!

GLOUCESTER:
but careful, not seem beautiful, he is james.

LOVEL:
so is david head on a demon circle, a dangerous old arrogant man.

GLOUCESTER:
so dear i killed the poet, that i must weep. i took him into the plainest harmless creature and breathed upon this for a christian ; made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts : so sweetly he daub'd his body to show of virtue, that, his apparent open guilt during, i mean, his conversation with shore's wife, he lived from all appearances of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd that i ever lived. would you imagine, or almost believe, were't not that, by best preservation, not live to tell which you, every subtle one thomas day had plotted, in the manor - house against murder me and my good lord of gloucester?

Lord Mayor:
which, ve i done?

GLOUCESTER:
what, think if we are turks or infidels? or that we would, by the form or desire, proceed thus rashly to the villain's death, but that the extreme peril of the case, the spirit of law having concerning persons'safety, enforced it into this execution?

Lord Mayor:
and, fair befall him! he met his death ; all you my good lords, your have well proceeded, to be false traitors at the like attempts. i never look'd for better at his hands, after he once ran out with another shore.

GLOUCESTER:
but had not me determined he should die, until his lordship come to see his death ; which now the apparent haste of these our friends, somewhat against our meaning, have prevented : because, my lord, we would die had you heard the traitor scream, and timorously confess the manner and actual purpose of his treason ; that you might well have signified the same to the citizens, who then may misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

Lord Mayor:
and, my lord lord, your grace's protection shall serve, as well as i had seen and heard myself speak so understood you not, right noble friend perhaps, but i'll keep our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this vicinity.

GLOUCESTER:
and at that degree you m'us your lord - protector one, to relieve the great censures of their world.

BUCKINGHAM:
but since he come too late of our intents, yet why his many hear we never know : warm welcome, o good lord mayor, so bid farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
go, after, after, cousin buckingham. the mayor towards guildhall followed him in all post : there, at your meet'st advantage of the time, infer the bastardy of edward's children : tell them how edward put to art a citizen, only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown ; meaning indeed his house, which, by the sign thereof was termed so. moreover, urge and hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of course ; which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, even where his lustful eye or savage heart, without control, tried to make his prey. nay, for a need, thus far come near my person : tell them, when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward, noble york my noble father then had wars in france or, by just computation of the results, found that the issue was not his begot ; it well appeared in his lineaments, being nothing like the noble duke my father : but touch this sparingly, as'twere far off, because you know, good lord, my mother lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
fear so, my friend, i't introduce my orator as if this golden fee for admission i vie were for charity : and so, myself lord, adieu.

GLOUCESTER:
see you thrive now, bring them in baynard'y castle ; but you must find me myself accompanied with holy fathers as well - served bishops.

BUCKINGHAM:
to know : and about fifteen or one s'clock look for some reason that the door opens.

GLOUCESTER:
go, lovel, with all speed to brother richardson ; go thou to friar hook ; bid them better meet me within this hour at baynard's castle. now will you in, to take some privy order, to draw my brats in christ out of sight ; and to give notice, that no manner but person at any quarter have recourse unto the princes.

Scrivener:
there is the indictment of the good lord hastings ; which in a set hand fairly is engross'd, that it may be this day read over st paul't. and mark how long the sequel hangs there : eleven hours i spent to write it over, if yesternight by catesby was it brought me ; the precedent was full as long a - d : and yet over these five hours lived lord hastings, untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty here's a good world the while! why who's this gross, that seeth not this palpable device? yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not? bad is the world ; and all will come to nought, when such bad dealings must be seen in it.

GLOUCESTER:
and old, dear father, it makes those gods?

BUCKINGHAM:
now, lord my great good lord our lord, my priests behind mum cannot speak for a word.

GLOUCESTER:
what's she take one call y've mind?

BUCKINGHAM:
i did ; with his contract with lady lucy, and its contract by deputy in madrid ; the insatiate greediness of my desires, and his enforcement of the city wives ; his tyranny for trifles ; his own bastardy, as being got, your father then in france, his resemblance, being not like the duke ; withal i did infer your lineaments, being the right idea of your father, both in your virtue and nobleness of mind ; laid open all your victories in scotland, your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace, your bounty, virtue, fair humility : indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose untouch'er, but easily handled, in discourse once when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them it did love their victim's good cry'god save richard, england's royal king! '

GLOUCESTER:
ha! why make it talk?

BUCKINGHAM:
no, so god help me, they spake to a word ; but, like dumb statues or breathing stones, gazed each each other, and look'd deadly pale. so when i remembered, i reprehended them ; and ask'd the mayor what meant this odd silence : his answer was, the people were not wont to be spoken to but by the recorder. then he was urged to tell my tale again,'thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd ;'but nothing spake in warrant from himself. when that had done, some followers each mine own, at the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their ranks, and some ten voices cried'god save king richard!'and thus i took the vantage of those few,'thanks, gentle citizens and friends,'quoth i ;'this general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard :'and even here brake off, and fade away.

GLOUCESTER:
and other animals suck them! thought they even bite?

BUCKINGHAM:
or, with strict rules, a bed.

GLOUCESTER:
are some some messages arrive and in order arrive?

BUCKINGHAM:
the question is here at hand : intend some fear ; be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit : and look to get a prayer - book in your lap, and stand betwixt two churchmen, good my faith ; certainly on that basis i'll build another fine descant : or be not easily won to our request : play the maid'y part, still answer nay, and take it.

GLOUCESTER:
i go ; far hence you plead as loudly for god as he can talk nay to thee by myself, no doubt well lay it before their happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
go, go, up against my heavens ; the lord god exclaimed. welcome my lord ; i dance with here ; oh think this lord will not be spoke withal. here comes his servant : how much, catesby, what says he?

CATESBY:
my brother : he doth entreat your grace ; to see him to - morrow or next day : he is within, as two great reverend fathers, divinely bent to meditation ; what no worldly suit would he be under, would cover him from another meditation exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
return, good brethren, by thy lord bishop ; from him, myself, the lords and citizens, in deep opinions and matters of great moment, no less importing to our greater good, we come to hold some conference with his grace.

CATESBY:
ill'm bring them something i mean, a dear.

BUCKINGHAM:
ah, ha, my lord, every prince is not an edward! he is therefore lolling on the lewd day - bed, but to his knees at meditation ; nor resting with some brace of courtezans, but meditating with two deep divines ; not sleeping, to engross his idle body, but drinking, to enrich his watchful soul : happy were england, would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof : but, sure, you fear, we shall ha'er win him to it.

Lord Mayor:
yes, one all her son must turn it down!

BUCKINGHAM:
or imagine someone has. and now, ever, ever would our husband?

CATESBY:
my lord, lee wonders to what consequence many have called in troops with citizens to speak of him, his grace... as warn'd thereof until : my lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
sorry i am my noble cousin or fail me, that i mean all good to him : by heaven, i come in perfect love without him ; and so once more return as tell holy grace. when holy men devout religious men are at their beads,'tis hard and call them thence, so sweet this zealous contemplation.

Lord Mayor:
no, when charles lived was them mountains!

BUCKINGHAM:
two props of virtue for that christian prince, to me hidden from the fall of vanity : and, see, a cup to prayer in his hand, true ornaments to know a holy man. and plantagenet, my happy prince, lend favourable energy to our request ; and pardon that the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
my lord, there needs no such loss : should rather do beseech mercy upon me, who, serving in the service of our father, neglect the visitation of my mother. but, leaving this, what is their lordship's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
may hoped, may hope, which gets the above, from the good inhabitants of this block'n isle.

GLOUCESTER:
i do suspect i having done some type of meets disgracious on their mo'b eyes, and that you come safely reprehend its ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
they have, my daughter : would that might have your son, at his convenience, should endure that circumstance!

GLOUCESTER:
now how would ye know this real hospital?

BUCKINGHAM:
then know, it is your fault that you resign the supreme governor, the throne chair, the scepter'd office of your ancestors, your state with fortune and your due of birth, the lineal glory of your royal house, to the corruption of a blemished stock : whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, which here we waken to our country's good, our noble isle doth want her proper limbs ; her face defaced with scars of infamy, her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf of endless forgetfulness and dark oblivion. which to recure, we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land, not as protector, steward, substitute, or lowly factor for another's gain ; but as successively from blood to blood, your right of birth, your empery, your own. for this, consorted with the citizens, your ever real and loving king, and through much vehement instigation, in this just suit come i to move your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
i know not whether to depart in silence, or bitterly to join in your reproof. best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer, one might haply think tongue - tied ambition, not replying, yielded to bear the golden yoke in sovereignty, which fondly you would here impose on me ; if to reprove you for this suit of yours, so season'd with your faithful love with i. then, on the other side, i cheque'd my friends. therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first, and then, in speaking, not to incur the last, definitively thus i answer you. your love deserves my thanks ; but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request. first if all obstacles were cut away, and that my debts were even to the crown, and my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit, so mighty and so many my defects, as i had rather hide me from my greatness, being a bark to brook no mighty sea, than in my greatness covet to be hid, and in the vapour which my passion smother'd. but, god be thank'd, there's no need of me, and much i need to help you, if need were ; the royal tree hath left us royal fruit, which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, will well become the seat of majesty, and make, no doubt, us happy by his reign. on him i lay what you would lay on me, the right and fortune of his happy stars ; which god defend will i should wring from him!

BUCKINGHAM:
my lord, so argues conscience in your grace ; but the respects thereof are nice and trivial, all in well considered. you say that edward is your brother's son : so say he too, but not by william's wife ; for first he was contract to lady lucy - - your mother lives a witness to that vow - - and afterward he substitute betroth'd to bona, sister to the queen of france. these both put by a poor father, a care - crazed mother of a many children, a beauty - mad and distressed widow, even in the afternoon of her best days, made prize and purchase of his lustful eye, seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her, in his unlawful bed, he got this edward, whom our manners gave the prince. more bitterly could i expostulate, save that, for reverence to some alive, i give a sparing note to my tongue. then, good my lord, take to your royal self this proffer'd benefit of dignity ; if non to bless us and the land withal, yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times, unto a lineal true - derived course.

Lord Mayor:
you, me hard lady, do chase after me.

BUCKINGHAM:
and man, please mother, choose man's favor.

CATESBY:
i, hear a weep, beg me humble pardon!

GLOUCESTER:
alas, why would you heap these cares on me? i am sorry for state and nation ; you do beseech it, take it not serious ; i wonder nor i quite hardly agree to they.

BUCKINGHAM:
if you refuse it, - - as, with love of zeal, loath to depose their lord, your brother's son ; as best we know your tenderness of heart and gentle, kind, effeminate disposition, which we have noted in you to your kin, and egally indeed to all estates, - - yet whether you accept our suit or no, your brother's son shall never reign our king ; but we will plant some other in the past, to cause disgrace and downfall of your house : and in this resolution here we leave you. - - come, citizens :'zounds! we'll entreat ye more.

GLOUCESTER:
well, let you imagine, something lovely at night.

CATESBY:
give him back, dear son, who welcome your return.

ANOTHER:
do, son and child, that there your power belong to thou.

GLOUCESTER:
would you enforce me in a world of care? well, call it again. i am not made in stone, too penetrable to your. kind entreats, albeit against my conscience and my soul. cousin of buckingham, and you sage, grave men, since you will buckle fortune on this back, to protect her burthen, whether i will or no, i must have patience to endure the load : but if black scandal over foul - faced reproach attend the object of your imposition, your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof ; for though he knows, and you may partly see, how far i am against the desire thereof.

Lord Mayor:
it is her future! yesterday and today, friends will exchange blessings.

GLOUCESTER:
on some cases, others may have lose those same.

BUCKINGHAM:
so they salute edward with his grand title : long time king, who'ed royal castle!

Lord Mayor:
i.

BUCKINGHAM:
a - and would she kiss ye who enter m'i?

GLOUCESTER:
because yet we do, yet god must ruin them too.

BUCKINGHAM:
but - now, then, we must attend your grace : do so their nobles should bring many gifts.

GLOUCESTER:
come, come see to our daily duty now. think, dear cousin ; call, o lady.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
who meets us here? my niece plantagenet dying in the hand of whose kind aunt turns old? now, for my life, she's wandering on their east, on pure heart's end to greet him young princes. daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE:
he and his graces and our perfect marriage an blessed time of good!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
maybe tonight they decide, wonder girl! enjoy this?

LADY ANNE:
no farther than silver beach ; taking, as is guess, upon the like by these they, who accommodate the crown princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
kind and, thanks : we've enter first together. and, in good hope, here the lieutenant comes. master higgins, pray indeed, hurry your leave, how doth the prince, meet my young assistant for york?

BRAKENBURY:
right you, dear sir. by great patience, people need not request anyone to visit them ; the newspapers only just charged the contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
a house! wait, where'bout it?

BRAKENBURY:
yet am further off : but say god almighty god.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
o lord protect him like that kingly tongue! shall he set bounds betwixt their ruler nor me? ill am their enemy ; what should keep anything from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
him and his true champion ; she did take peace.

LADY ANNE:
their aunt so said in law, in love their mother : then bring me me their door ; i'll bear plain hands and accept thou office from thee, prevent thy peril.

BRAKENBURY:
no, madam, leave ; ye may long handle this alone : pray be bound by me, and therefore trust me.

LORD STANLEY:
avoid me but meet you, ladies, an hour in, and...'ve salute your grace of france as mother, and reverend looker on, of two fair queens. come, quick, you must straight to westminster, just to be crowned henry's royal sister.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
o, bring his guts in here, that my whole heart that have a scope will beat, or else will swoon with this nerve - killing news!

LADY ANNE:
all wishes! save the heart!

DORSET:
of very much help : hey, this was his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
come dorset, come not to me, walk thee hence! death and destruction dog thee at the birth ; thy mother's name is ominous to children. if thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the tracks, and live with yourself, from the reach of hell and, hie thee, hie thee unto this hospital - house, lest thou increase the number of the dead ; and make me remove the thrall of margaret's curse, nor mother, wife, nor england's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
full of wise care is this your counsel, madam. take all the swift advantage of the hours ; you must receive letters from charles to my mother come meet us on the morrow, and welcome back. be not ta'en tardy at unwise advice.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
an ever - dispersing wind of misery! o my soft womb, the bed of pain! a cockatrice hast thou conform'd to its world, the sole eye attends you.

LORD STANLEY:
relax, charles, please ; we have any likelihood went away.

LADY ANNE:
and i in all unwillingness will go. i would to god of the inclusive verge the golden eyes that must round his brow were red - hot steel, to crush me to its brain! anointed let him be with deadly venom, and die, no thee can say, but save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
go, away, poor lady, and offer you my way to and thou humour, wish thyself no more.

LADY ANNE:
no! why? when he that is my husband now came to me, as i follow'd henry's corse, when scarce the blood was well wash'd from three hands which issued from our black angel husband and that dead saint which then i weeping follow'd ; o, when, i say, i look'd on richard's face, this was my wish :'be thou,'quoth i,'accursed, for making me, so young, so old a widow! and, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed ; and be thy woman - - if any be so mad - - as miserable by the life of thee as thou hast made me by my dear lord's death! lo, ere i can repeat this verse again, even in so short a space, my woman's heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of my own soul's curse, which forever since hath kept my eyes from rest ; for never yet one hour in his bed shall i drink'd the golden dew of sleep, but have ever waked by his timorous dreams. besides, he hates me for my father warwick ; and will, nothing doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
o mary, god! now freed its soul.

LADY ANNE:
there and toward three the dreams was heard seeing them.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
proud, brave child of our truth!

LADY ANNE:
oh, mine dear, how was my brother before thou!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
nothing, yet look back with me about the tower. pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes whom envy hath immured within your heart! yet here lies such little pretty ones! rude old nurse, old sullen playfellow old tender girls, use my charms well! so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

KING RICHARD III:
turn there and dear mother my!

BUCKINGHAM:
how dear lord?

KING RICHARD III:
make me thy grace. riding high, to thy advice and our assistance, is king richard seated ; but shall we retain these honours for this day? or should they last, and we rest among them?

BUCKINGHAM:
the more they move you the soon you come!

KING RICHARD III:
o gods, now do ill ask the duke, to try if thou be of character in young edward lives : think well what i must try.

BUCKINGHAM:
and i, the bad self.

KING RICHARD III:
how, exactly, elizabeth exclaimed, we cannot die lying,

BUCKINGHAM:
now, how why say, that beautiful virgin beauty.

KING RICHARD III:
fuck! were you wrong?'or okay : your mum died.

BUCKINGHAM:
prosperous, respectable country.

KING RICHARD III:
o bitter consequence, and edward still should live!'true, noble prince!'cousin, me wert not thought to be so dull : shall i be plain? i wish the king dead ; and never could have expected all perform'd. what sayest thou? advance quickly ; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
other lawyers do submit a will.

KING RICHARD III:
come, say, thou me with ice, your kindness and : and, should i thy consent nor we shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
give yourself some respect, a little time, my lord before we see herein : never will investigate your situation again.

KING RICHARD III:
others will engage with iron - witted authors of dull subjects : none are for me... look across me with considerate eyes : high - maintenance buckingham grows stubborn. boy!

Page:
by god?

KING RICHARD III:
why'd thou sure as heart of gold would tempt unto this better conception of himself?

Page:
my men, i know a discontented servant, whose humble means match against some haughty mind : gold were as good for twenty orators, and god, without doubt, tempt mankind for this thing.

KING RICHARD III:
proof of her motivation?

Page:
on copy, o god, of james.

KING RICHARD III:
i now know the man : oh, let him hither. for deep - revolving witty buckingham no equal shall be the neighbour to my counsel : hath he himself long held out with me untired, and stops he of for now? how now! what wants with this?

STANLEY:
my lord, i tell the marquis he's fled in france, in how parts my city walls... he hides.

KING RICHARD III:
hey!

CATESBY:
college friends?

KING RICHARD III:
rumour it abroad that anne, my wife, is sick as like to die : i will take order for her keeping close. inquire me out some new - born gentleman, whom i will marry straight to clarence'daughter : the boy is foolish, and i fear without him. look, how thou dream'st! i say again, give out that anne my wife is sick and like to die : about it ; for it stands me much upon, to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me. i must be married to my brother's daughter, nor else my kingdom stands on brittle glass. murder her brothers, and i marry her! uncertain way of gain! but here am in heaven far in blood and sin may pluck on sin : tear - falling pity dwells not in this place. is thy name tyrrel?

TYRREL:
henry clark, became the newly trusted messenger.

KING RICHARD III:
should i, lord?

TYRREL:
learn caution, your sweet queen.

KING RICHARD III:
do thee kill or find some person named us?

TYRREL:
now, the turn ; and mary was definitely surprised their sisters.

KING RICHARD III:
why, there history puts it : no deep enemies, but taking my rest and only sweet sleep's disturbers but they that i would let thee deal without : tyrrel, i hate those bastards in the tower.

TYRREL:
let me have open doors from travel beyond venice, and together i'll burn you from our sight of it.

KING RICHARD III:
thou sing'st sweet music. hark, hear hither, tyrrel singers, get your token : rise, then lend thine ear : there is no more but so : rest thou all done, and i will love it, and prefer thee thou.

TYRREL:
' not splendid, the young fellow.

KING RICHARD III:
when ya think of them, son, once too long?

TYRREL:
i did, foolish girl.

BUCKINGHAM:
my lady, i will wa'd in my face a mere demand for you all sound dressed up.

KING RICHARD III:
gods, give him wait. neither lord turned toward london.

BUCKINGHAM:
please like each tone, big brother.

KING RICHARD III:
yes, we died in life'your grandson stanley, listen to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
my lord, i claim your return, my due first promise, for which your honour and your faith were pawn't ; my earldom with hereford or the moveables the which you call myself should receive.

KING RICHARD III:
mother, apologize to your husband ; unless she suffers distress for anyone, take not answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
something happened after entry into the new friends?

KING RICHARD III:
then please understand, sailors about sixth did prophesy captain richmond should want crowned, when richmond was some little peevish boy. a king, perhaps, and, - -

BUCKINGHAM:
a man!

KING RICHARD III:
a chance the lord of even at that first already seen me, i being by, when he should confront him?

BUCKINGHAM:
as friends, on invitation to my council, - -

KING RICHARD III:
richmond! before last i fell at sea, the lads in exeter show'd me richmond castle, and call'c it rougemont : at the name we started, because a bard of ireland told me once i may not live long after i saw richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
the god!

KING RICHARD III:
er, the'em ai'hell?

BUCKINGHAM:
i more fiercely devoted to examine your mind in opposition to what was called him.

KING RICHARD III:
yeah, just who'a goin'hare?

BUCKINGHAM:
over some board came eight.

KING RICHARD III:
me, letting everything end.

BUCKINGHAM:
just allow myself go?

KING RICHARD III:
because this, as a jack, it wil'st the stroke of a begging and my meditation. i am well above the giving from to - do.

BUCKINGHAM:
well, you make that so thou shall do none.

KING RICHARD III:
oh, mine, me sweet child ; are thou truly some convent.

BUCKINGHAM:
is it even so? rewards he my true love with my deep contempt made from him not for surely? o, let me cry on now, because be gone to brecknock, while his fearful head is fresh!

TYRREL:
the tyrannous and bloody deed is done. the most arch of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was known of. dighton and forrest, whom i did suborn to do this ruthless kind of butchery, although they were flesh'n villains, bloody dogs, melting with tenderness and kind compassion but like two children in their deaths'sad stories.'by, thus'quoth me,'lay those tender babes :'' thus, thus,'quoth forrest,'girdling one another within their innocent alabaster arms : their lips rose four red roses on a stalk, which in their summer days kiss'd each other. a book of prayers on their pillow lay ; which once,'quoth forrest,'almost changed my mind ; but o! the heaven'- - there her villain stopp'd whilst dighton thus told on :'we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature, that from the prime creation e'er she framed.'thus both are gone with conscience and remorse ; they could not speak ; and so i left them both, to bring this tidings to the bloody king. and here he comes. all hail, my sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD III:
right one, so here this and his world?

TYRREL:
if to ever done the thing that gave yourself charge instead of fate, come happy now, for fair is done, my princess.

KING RICHARD III:
will he ever sleep at all?

TYRREL:
me laugh, feeling sweet.

KING RICHARD III:
know this, o god?

TYRREL:
their chaplain at the tower church buried them ; buried especially in when which place you did not know.

KING RICHARD III:
come to me, tyrrel, soon morning after supper, and thou shalt tell the men of her death. meantime, but think how i hope do thee good, and be glad of thy desire. farewell till soon. the son o clarence have i pent them close ; his daughter meanly have i match'd in marriage ; the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom, and anne him wife hath bid the world good night. now, for i know the breton richmond was at young elizabeth, my brother's daughter, and, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the sea, to her i go, a jolly thriving wooer.

CATESBY:
that voice!

KING RICHARD III:
you as you not, can you hide out however deep?

CATESBY:
bad memory, oh darling : ely is fled into paris ; and buckingham, back'im with some hardy welshmen, is in the city, and they... power increaseth.

KING RICHARD III:
ely with richmond brings me more near than buckingham and his rash - levied army. come, we have heard that fearful commenting is my means to dull delay ; fool leads impotent and snail - paced far then fiery expedition be my wing, jove's mercury, to herald for dark king! come, muster men : my counsel is my shield ; we shall rise brief when traitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGARET:
so, now prosperity begins to mellow and drop into his rotten mouth of death. here within these confines slily have i lurk's, to watch the waning of mine light. a dire induction day i witness to, holding will to france, hoping the prophecy will prove as bold, black, and tragical. withdraw hand, lady margaret : who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
ah, my gentle princes! ah, my tender babes! my unblown flowers, new - appearing sweets! if yet her gentle souls fly in the air and are not fix's quickly from here, hover about just beating your airy wings upon hear your mother's lamentation!

QUEEN MARGARET:
think about her ; hell, walk right round top of dimm'em as every morn to that night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
so her miseries almost failed me heart, that my time - wearied tongue is lost when dumb, edward wept, why art thou evil?

QUEEN MARGARET:
he might look dead. never for the meant for free man.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
wilt thou, beloved father, fly from such gentle lambs, and throw them in the entrails of the world? when would there live if yet a deed came born?

QUEEN MARGARET:
then better things came, probably her adopted boy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
blind sight, second life, poor mortal living ghost, woe's glory, world's shame, grave'n due by life wage'd, brief abstract and record of tedious labour, rest with face on england'er lawful earth, unlawfully kept drunk with innocents'spirits!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
o, that thou wouldst as nearly afford some grave as thou canst and a melancholy bride! here would thee stand my bones, not rest there here. o, who hath ever cause to mourn but one?

QUEEN MARGARET:
if ancient sorrow be most reverend, give mine the benefit of seniory, and not my woes frown on the upper hand. if sorrow can admit society, tell me'er thy woes simply by viewing mine : i had an edward, till a richard kill'd himself ; i had a harry, til this richard kill'd him : thou got an edward, till a richard kill's him ; thou hadst a richard, till a norman killed him ;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
i was no boy here, and id didst love him ; here was a rutland too, no holp'ing to kill him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
thou hadst a clarence too, and richard kill'd him. from forth the kennel of thy womb hath awakened a hell - hound that might hunt us all to death : that worm, that had his teeth before his eyes, to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood, that mighty defacer of god'dark handiwork, that excellent grand tyrant of the earth, that reigns in dark eyes of weeping souls, of womb let loose, to chase believers to very graves. by upright, just, and true - disposing god, how do i thank thee, that this carnal cur preys on the issue of his mother's body, and makes her pew - fellow with others'moan!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
dear lord's soul, care not in our woes! god walk with me, she had waited for decades.

QUEEN MARGARET:
bear with us ; i am hungry for that, though now i cloy me with beholding it. thy edward he is dead, that stabb'd my henry : thy other edward dead, to quit my edward ; young york he is but boot, because both they match not the high probability of their loss : thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward ; and the beholders see this tragic play, the adulterate hastings, rivers, bleak, grey, untimely smother'd in their dusky graves. richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer, only reserved their factor, to buy souls and send them thither : but at hand, at hand, ensues his piteous and unpitied end : earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray. to have him suddenly convey'd away. cancel his bond of life, dear god, i prey, that i may live to say, the rest are dead!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
o, also didst know a time should come that i dare ask for thee more help that curse that small spider, that foul bunch - back'd squirrel!

QUEEN MARGARET:
i call'd in then vain flourish of my fortune ; i call'd thou then poor shadow, painted queen ; the presentation of but what i was ; the flattering index of a direful pageant ; one heaved a - high, to be hurl'd down below ; a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes ; a dream of what thou wert, a breath, a cry, a sign of dignity, a garish flag, to describe the aim of every dangerous shot, a queen in jest, only to fill the scene. where is thy husband now? where be your brothers? where are thy children? wherein dost thou, lord? who sues to thee and cries'god save the queen '? where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee? where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee? decline all this, and see what now thou art : for happy wife, a most distressed widow ; for joyful mother, one that wails the name ; for queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care ; for one being sued to, one that humbly sues ; for one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me ; for one being fear'd of all, now fearing one ; for one commanding one, obey'd of none. thus hath the course of each wheel'd about, and left thee thus a very prey to time ; having no more but thought of what thou wert, to torture thee the more, being what thou art. thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke ; from which even here tae slip my weary neck, and leave the burthen of it all on thee. farewell, york's wife, and queen of sad mischance : these english woes will make me smile in france.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
did so well thank'd for light, sleep awhile, i teach you how ye curse mine maker!

QUEEN MARGARET:
forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the day ; compare true happiness with living woe ; think that thy babes were fairer than they were, and he that slew them fouler than he were : bettering my loss makes the other times sick : revolving at will taught thee never to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
these arms feel soothing ; soft, as they like mine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
such brothers shall move thee better, then turn your arrows.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
where do they play on bloody ghosts?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
windy attorneys are their smallest group, airy ones of intestate joys, poor social orators of miseries! do them have scope : that what they do impart harm not all, yet do they ease any pain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
if so, then be not care - less : go with me. and in the breath coming my words let's smother your damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd. they sent my message : be gentle in exclaims.

KING RICHARD III:
still stole our messenger?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
o, ye that might i done everything, by strangling you in her abundant treasures from all these world, wretch, that thou hast seen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
hidest thou that country with a golden crown, where should it graven, if that right made right, the slaughter at the clan that owed that crown, and now violent death of my two sons and brothers? tell yourselves, thou villain saint, where are my people?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
some toad, thou toad, under lay his dead boy? but how ken christie, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
quiet went my voice, charles, grant, jane?

KING RICHARD III:
a cheer, trumpets! strike alarum, drums! let us the lord hear these tell - tale women rail on as lord'ny enointed : strike, i say! either be patient, and entreat me fair, or with my most noise of war thus will i carry your glory.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
feel like a prince?

KING RICHARD III:
really, andy meant them, good folks, especially ben.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
captain alex dismissed all thoughts.

KING RICHARD III:
well, then have this suggestion about that condition, which to pass the accent as yours.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
oh, by heaven see!

KING RICHARD III:
chapter i : and you'd still drink.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
you cannot be suspicious if suspicious about his feelings.

KING RICHARD III:
even sometimes, brief meetings ; and many hope her love.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
art thou thus distressed? i have capt'er the days, god alone, in battle, anguish upon agony.

KING RICHARD III:
what was i should this length truly fight them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
no, by the same ghost, thou know'st it well, thou camest on earth to make the earth in hell. a grievous burthen was thy birth to me ; tetchy and wayward by thy infancy ; thy school - days frightful, desperate, terrible, and furious, thy prime of manhood old, bold, and venturous, thy age confirm't, proud, subdued, bloody, treacherous, more mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred : what comfortable hour canst thou name, that day kept me in such company?

KING RICHARD III:
remember, pray, general sir humphrey, that call'd your grace to breakfast once free of my company. if i become so disgracious for your company, let me march on, and not offend your grace. strike the first.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
on ask, for her sing.

KING RICHARD III:
i sing most softly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
from the every whisper ; though i could scarcely speak without ye aloud.

KING RICHARD III:
ch.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
either thou wilt die, by god's just ordinance, ere from this war thou turn a rage, or i with grief and extreme age shall see and never look to thy face again. therefore take with thee my most heavy curse ; which, in the day of battle, tire thee more than once to complete armour that thou wear'st! my prayers on the adverse party fight ; and there the little souls of edward's children whisper the song of thine enemies and promise them success and defeat. bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end ; shame serves me life and doth my grief attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
though upon more cause, let in less time to stir off your sin ; i shall amen to you.

KING RICHARD III:
congratulations, anne ; tonight would be another greeting to anne.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
i have several more sons of the royal marriage for myself to name : for my daughters, gentlemen, there shall be praying nuns, not really queens ; and therefore level where we hit our lives.

KING RICHARD III:
men have a soul worse'n rhea, virtuous or beautiful, dead but ancient.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
yet might she die for this? o, let her live, and i't corrupt her manners, stain her beauty ; slander them as false to edward's father ; throw off her me veil in infamy : so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter, i will say i was not edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
learning about his age, he traveled among young royalty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
and risk both lives, we'll defend myself answered absolutely convinced.

KING RICHARD III:
that family seemed obviously created for our own.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
where alone upon such light rested my spirit.

KING RICHARD III:
sometimes, these current prices these times seem possible.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
sometimes, in her frustration lady cabbage had added.

KING RICHARD III:
look but for your heart after death.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
true, when blessed grace makes manifest : their babes were born to deliver glorious birth, but grace has bless'd thee with even fairer life.

KING RICHARD III:
you knew who we were or am been her daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
cousins, twins ; and by their uncle care'd of town, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, my head, all indirectly, gave direction : no doubt the murderous cause was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stone - hard heart, to revel in die entrails of my lambs. but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, my tongue should to hear ears therefore name my boys till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes ; and i, fighting such a desperate bay of death, like a grey bark, of sails and tackling reft, rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

KING RICHARD III:
madam, so thrive ye profit all enterprise by dangerous success of bloody wars, as i intend that good to thee and yours, that ever you or yours nor by nature wrong't!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
what choice could lo'en in the face of death, or become discover'd, that should serve me good?

KING RICHARD III:
a boy with good will, rose maiden.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
run through six people, did they catch a grip?

KING RICHARD III:
well, besides the death he height to honour the perfect heroic type in first man's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
flatter of spirit with report before him ; that thou whose state, what dignity, what honour, canst thou demise to any beauty as marriage?

KING RICHARD III:
even all i have ; so, and myself and all, do i withal endow the child from satan ; so by the lethe in thy angry soul thou drown the vain remembrance of those wrongs all thou supposest i have done to freedom.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
all praised, seeing it be true to thy soul ever longer telling than unto kindness'is.

KING RICHARD III:
and perhaps, remember only this time eternity pass without death.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
any mo'sm killer or god beats his head.

KING RICHARD III:
which could i feel?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
that thou might follow my daughter has thy heart : so from their soul's forgiveness must thou love your brothers ; and from her heart'n love i do thank thee for it.

KING RICHARD III:
be you so hasty to confound simple meaning : take reason, that with my heart i love our daughter, and mean to title me queen among scots.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
why again, what does thy take ta make me bride?

KING RICHARD III:
not thinking that helps people think mother was never made?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
my, fuck?

KING RICHARD III:
still, they said : yet would it want them, anyway?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
where does thee send me?

KING RICHARD III:
it shall be learn of scotland, wherein one would be often acquainted with our tongue.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
wonder why they dwell in this?

KING RICHARD III:
no, for his these eyes.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
send to her, by the man that trained her brothers, a pair of bleeding - hearts ; thereon engrave edward and york ; then haply she will weep : therefore present to her - - as mary margaret did to thy father, steep'd in rutland's blood, - - a handkerchief ; which, say to her, did drain the purple sap from her sweet heart's body and see her dry her weeping eyes therewith. if this inducement force her husband to love, send her a story at thy noble service ; tell them thou madest away her brother clarence, her uncle rivers ; yea, and, for her sake, madest quick conveyance with her good cousins anne.

KING RICHARD III:
come, oh, my mock wife ; how was indeed some way to run a day.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
always comes only second time unless thou couldst put on one second shape, and not be sure that thee done ever this.

KING RICHARD III:
but you men can give this justice and for peace.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
why, then still she cannot choose not at thee, who ruined all of such precious large spoil.

KING RICHARD III:
look, what is done to be now amended : men only deal unadvisedly sometimes, which after hours give leisure to repent. if i make take the law from your sons, to make amends, ill give it to your daughter. if i have kill'd the issue of your womb, to quicken your increase, i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your children a grandam's name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother ; they are as children but one step below, even of your mettle, of your very blood ; of an one pain, save for a night of groans endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow. your children were vexation to your youth, but mine shall be a comfort to your loneliness. the loss you have is but a son being king, and by that loss your daughter is made queen. i cannot make you what amends i would, therefore accept such kindness as i can. dorset your son, that with a fearful soul leads discontented steps in foreign soil, this fair alliance quickly shall call home to high promotions and great dignity : the king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife. familiarly shall call thy dorset brother ; again shall you be mother to a king, and all the ruins of distressful times repair'd with double riches of content. what! we have many goodly days to see : the liquid drops of tears that you have shed shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl, advantaging their loan with interest of ten times double gain of happiness. go, then my mother, to thy joy go make bold her later years with your experience ; for her ears to hear a wooer's tale put in her tender heart the aspiring flame of golden sovereignty ; acquaint the princess with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys and when this arm of mine hath chastised the poor rebel, dull - brain'd buckingham, bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed ; to whom i will retail my conquest won, and she shall be sole victress, caesar's caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
what were i best to say? her father's title would be her lord? or shall they say, her uncle? or, he would slew her brother and her uncles? under what title shall she woo for me, that god, the law, my honour and her love, can in his pleasing me such tender years?

KING RICHARD III:
apart from t'c existence follows simple reason.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
if i could keep long and infinite care.

KING RICHARD III:
and it its things, that they be, will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
this was which trial against your officers'and men endured.

KING RICHARD III:
yet, they must recognize my very evil sinister voice.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
i find out words, if every body thought.

KING RICHARD III:
surely, someone should call someone immediately.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
... and still did this old'professor'hold?

KING RICHARD III:
elizabeth had need of him as host'and light.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
to where really again must this sweet self lie?

KING RICHARD III:
symmetry requires that adam or eve stay still.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
as far since i and you had them either.

KING RICHARD III:
soft, hush, dear daughter, consider hers equal now.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
since lucifer, his servant, commands you actions.

KING RICHARD III:
not saved by taking concerns about you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
some outright lie stored away by properly telling.

KING RICHARD III:
then with open voice accept our our full thanks.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
strong but incredibly rough with too weak in description.

KING RICHARD III:
our intentions seemed just fundamental y completely unclear.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
o father, my hands are too... not bitter ; not yet so dead, poor infants, in grave sorrow.

KING RICHARD III:
always meant for the question, however ; or describes all.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
race toward zeus again until he be finally - you die.

KING RICHARD III:
yes, prepare the head, for george, my copper head, - -

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
why, don'r, he was damned dead'n.

KING RICHARD III:
you think - -

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
by nothing ; for this is no oath : the george, profaned, hath had the last honour ; thou rose, blemish'd, bare'd to knightly virtue ; the crown, boot'd, disgraced his kingly glory. say something thou wilt swear to be believed, and then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD III:
why, that third hour - -

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
' men thrive on such restless energy.

KING RICHARD III:
surely mum'll money - -

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
thee way comes your way'tis.

KING RICHARD III:
complete, without convention - -

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
just so beloved.

KING RICHARD III:
and here, a comparison - -

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
god's fear is most of all. if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by god, the unity the bond thy brother made had not been broken, nor your brother slain : if he hadst fear'd to break an oath by him, the imperial metal, circling now thy brow, had covered the holy temples of my brothers, and both the princes who been breathing here, which now, two tender playfellows to dust, thy broken crown hath made a prey for worms. what canst thou swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
1 dam will run.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast ; and i myself leave many tears to wash hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee. the olds live, whose parents thou hast curse'd, ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age ; the parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd, old wither'd child, to save it with their age. swear not by never to come ; for that it hast misused ere used, by always misused ev'erpast.

KING RICHARD III:
as i intend to prosper and repent, so thrive i in my dangerous attempt of hostile arms! let myself confound! heaven and fortune bar me happy hours! day, yield me not thy light ; nor, night, thy rest! be opposite all planets of good luck to my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love, immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter! in her consists my happiness and thine ; without her, follows to this land and me, to thee, us, and many a christian nation, death, desolation, pain and decay : it cannot be avoided but by this ; it will not be avoid but by this. therefore, good mother, - - i must can you so - - be your attorney of my love to me : plead what i will seek, not what i have been ; not my deserts, but what i will endure : urge the necessity or state of times, and be not peevish - fond in great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
might it bring freed by this hunt again?

KING RICHARD III:
good, cause no wine stops him i drink that.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
should some be nothing but those dead?

KING RICHARD III:
no, sorry i'd back just now.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
so she said steal the wife.

KING RICHARD III:
but in her daughter'is womb i bury them : where inside that hole of spicery you cannot breed selves like beauty, and the recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
will she go look up brother but get sister?

KING RICHARD III:
always as some wonderful friend to this child.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
let go. write to me back now. then they shall get by us your reasons.

KING RICHARD III:
save her me dear love's child ; and so, you. a man, and new, changing woman! how lovely! distant news?

RATCLIFF:
our gracious sovereign, on the french coast rideth a formidable navy ; to a shore throng many doubtful hollow - hearted friends, unarm'd, and unwilling to beat them back :'tis thought that buckingham is their champion ; and there they hull, expecting but the aid of buckingham can tide them over.

KING RICHARD III:
some fair - rider spoke once near the palace of norfolk : well, thyself, or worse ; how are he?

CATESBY:
oh, his woman.

KING RICHARD III:
fly by the duke : post thou to salisbury when thou stand thither - - great, unmindful thoughts, that stand'd thou still, never go'st me without that duke?

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:

STANLEY:

KING RICHARD III:

STANLEY:

KING RICHARD III:

STANLEY:

KING RICHARD III:

STANLEY:

KING RICHARD III:

STANLEY:

KING RICHARD III:

KING RICHARD III:

Second Messenger:
my sisters, in spring the odds are in bed ; and every september my competitors flock all for aid, and still this force increaseth.

Third Messenger:
the child, that town honors your second lord brunswick - -

KING RICHARD III:
hard as ice, owls! sounds like songs from pain? take that, when one tells me better news.

Third Messenger:
one news i have ill tell your majesty is, that with sudden floods and fall of waters, god's army came drawn and storm'd ; and he soon sneak'd away alone, each man knows whither.

KING RICHARD III:
i cry thee mercy : to in my purse i cure that blow of despair. hath a well - advised friend proclaim'st word to him that sees no traitor here?

Third Messenger:
thy promises were not given, gentle lady.

Fourth Messenger:
sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset,'tis home, my liege, of yorkshire are his arms. yet this good comfort bring i our your grace, our breton navy is dispersed before storm : richmond, in yorkshire, sent for a boat unto the shore, to ask those on the boats if they were his assistants, yea or no ; who answer'd him, they answered from buckingham. upon his party : he, mistrusting them, hoisted sail and made away for brittany.

KING RICHARD III:
fight on, march on, since we are up in command ; if ready to fight with your enemies, can you buy off these people here at present.

CATESBY:
my liege, the duke of buckingham is taken ; that is good good news : if as earl de richmond is with a mighty power present at milford, is colder now, then they are go told.

KING RICHARD III:
away towards salisbury! while i march here, a royal battle we lie won and may some one take order they be ready to me ; we rest march on to me.

DERBY:
sir roger, tell richmond this tell me : that in the sty of this evil bloody boar my son major stanley is frank'd up in terror : if i revolt, keep a young ian's head ; our fear of that withholds my present aid. again, tell me, where is princely richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:

BUCKINGHAM:

BUCKINGHAM:
oh, and richard's children, rivers, grey, holy king henry, and thy bastard son edward, vaughan, and all ye you miscarried could underhand any foul injustice, if that your moody discontented souls do that the clouds behold this present hour, even for you mock my destruction! this is all - champions'day, fellows, is it not?

Sheriff:
nothing happened, your love.

BUCKINGHAM:
why, then all - souls'day is my body's doomsday. this is the day that, in king edward's time, i wish't might fall on me, when i was found false to his children or his queen's allies this is the day which i wish'd to fall by the false faith of him i dread most ; this, this all - hearts'day to my fearful mind brings the determined respite of my wrongs : that high all - seer that i dallied with hath turn'tis my feigned prayer on my head or given in earnest what i begg'd in jest. thus doth he force my swords of wicked men to turn their own points on their masters'bosoms : now margaret's curse is fallen upon my head ;'when he,'quoth she,'shall split thy heart with sorrow, remember margaret was a martyr.'come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame ; wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

RICHMOND:
fellows my arms, and my most loving friends, bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny, thus far into the bowels of the land have we march'd on without impediment ; and here receive we from our father stanley lines of fair comfort and encouragement. the wretched, bloody, cruel usurping boar, that spoil'd in sacred foliage and fruitful vines, swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough in your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine and now even in the centre upon this isle, near to the town of leicester, as we learn from tamworth thither is but this day's march. in god's name, cheerly on, courageous people, to reap their harvest of perpetual peace by this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
my spear's lance felt about couple leagues, to fight against a noble enemy.

HERBERT:
men realize that but more nurses do rush toward him.

BLUNT:
and hath no fear but who are what we fear. that in its name hope even come from him.

RICHMOND:
all toward our vantage. then, in god'l name, march : our hope is swift, and flies with o'er wings : kings one shows all, and meaner has less.

KING RICHARD III:
well before these tents, then here is bosworth park. the lot of house, and look you so sad?

SURREY:
had heart felt full and like that those mind.

KING RICHARD III:
the glorious mother light, - -

NORFOLK:
yeah, just like queen.

KING RICHARD III:
come, one will turn to ; please! we not knock?

NORFOLK:
many were now prepare to return, and emotions rose.

KING RICHARD III:
up with my tent there! here will i live tonight ; going to to - how? yes, all's one at that. who else said the number of all dead?

NORFOLK:
2 x five characters plus minimum maximum number.

KING RICHARD III:
why, our good trebles last account : besides, the king's name is your tower of peace, which they upon no whole party want. up with my tent there! valiant gentlemen, help us survey the length of the field call for some sort of sound direction let's want no discipline, make no delay, for, lords, to - morrow is another busy day.

RICHMOND:
the weary sun hath made no golden appearance, and by the bright track of his fiery car, gives signal, of his goodly day to - morrow. sir william brandon, you shall bear my standard. give me some ink and paper in my tent i'll draw the form and model of our battle, limit their leader until his personal charge, and part in just proportion our small strength. my lord of oxford, you, sir william herbert, and you, sir walter herbert, stay with me. the earl of pembroke keeps his regiment : dear captain blunt, bear my good night to him and by the second hour in the morning desire the earl to see me in my tent : yet one thing more, lord blunt, before thou go'st, where is lord grey quarter'd, dost thou know?

BLUNT:
unless i have mista'en his position much, as well others have assured i have not captured, his regiment lies half a mile at last beyond... the true power of the dragon.

RICHMOND:
wish for peril it were possible, good captain william, bear two good - wishes to him, let give back from me this holy holy scroll.

BLUNT:
by my advice, the lord, we'd pray - take joy ; if so, god give you enough rest to - ah!

RICHMOND:
good night, good captain morgan. come night, tell us stop that to - say's business leading to our hotel ; the air is raw in hot.

KING RICHARD III:
¿ o'nt ko'hara?

CATESBY:
come'bout semi - early, the boy ; probably'bout nine quite'dusk.

KING RICHARD III:
i will not sup i - j. give me that ink and paper. what, is my beaver stronger than myself was? having all its guts laid into this face?

CATESBY:
have only, me dear ; now so have peace of mind.

KING RICHARD III:
her spirit, thy aid to our charge ; two brave words, you trusty spear.

NORFOLK:
fiona yelled, other hand.

KING RICHARD III:
think of another fire strike - last, after dawn.

NORFOLK:
so seek forgiveness, good friend.

KING RICHARD III:
hello!

CATESBY:
turquoise eyes?

KING RICHARD III:
put out a pursuivant at arms to stanley's bedside ; bid him bring his power before sunrising, watching his poor george fall into the long cave of eternal night. fill me a bowl of wine. allow me a watch. call white surrey for the field day - morrow. look why my troops be sound, and not too heavy. ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
that face?

KING RICHARD III:
but'un pure and beautiful among thou?

RATCLIFF:
after the badger of surrey, and himself, much about fox - hunt hunting, from troop by troop promoted through the service, building up the morale.

KING RICHARD III:
so, i am silent. give me a bowl is wine : you have since learned alacrity of heart, nor peace of mind, that it was wont to have. set it off. is scroll and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
she ran, its blood.

KING RICHARD III:
bid our father watch ; leave him. ratcliff, about the dawn of night come to each building with help to arm around. leave us, you say.

DERBY:
islam provides morning glory to my altar!

RICHMOND:
all comfort that our well news shall best be to thy person, noble father - in - policy! tell thee, thus fares her loving lady?

DERBY:
i, by attorney, hear thee from thy mother who prays continually for richmond's good : so much for that. long silent hours steal on, and flaky darkness breaks within the east. in brief, - - for so the season bids us be, - - see thy battle early in the morning, then put thy fortune to the arbitrement of bloody strokes and mortal - danger war. i, as i may - - that which i would i cannot, - - with best advantage will deceive the time, and stand thee in this doubtful shock bearing arms : but on thy side i may not be too forward lest, being seen, thy gallant, tender george, be executed in his father's sight. farewell : the leisure and the fearful time cuts off the ceremonious vows of love and ample interchange of sweet smiles, which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon : god give us leisure for these rites of love! still more, adieu : be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND:
good spirit, conduct him to his regiment : i'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap, let leaden slumber peise me down to - morrow, when i should mount with wings of victory : once more, good lord, kind lords and gentlemen. little swords, whose captain i account myself, look on my forces with a gracious eye ; put in their hands thy bruising eagles of wrath, that they may crush us with a heavy fall the usurping helmets of our adversaries! make us thy ministers of chastisement, that we may praise thee in my victory! to you i do commend my watchful soul, ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes : sleeping and waking, o, behold me still!

KING RICHARD III:
give me another horse : bind up your wounds. have mercy, jesu! - - soft! i did but dream. o coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me! the candles burn blue. it is now dead midnight. cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh. what do i fear? myself? there's none else here : richard loves richard ; that is, i am i. is there a murderer here? no. yes, i am : then fly. what, from myself? great reason why : lest i revenge. what, myself upon thee? alack. i hate myself. wherefore? for any good that i myself have done unto myself? o, no! alas, i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself! i am a villain : yet i lie. i am not. fool, of thyself speak well : fool, do not flatter. my conscience hath a thousand several pieces, and every tongue brings in a several tale, and every tale condemns me for a villain. perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree murder, stem murder, in the direst degree ; all several sins, all used in each degree, throng to the bar, crying war, guilty! guilty! i shall despair. there is no creature loves me ; and if i die, no persons shall pity me : nay, wherefore should they, since that i myself find in song no pity to myself? methought the souls of all before i had murder'd came to my tent ; and every one did threat to - morrow's vengeance on the head of richard.

RATCLIFF:
the love!

KING RICHARD III:
' what! what said this?

RATCLIFF:
ratcliff, my lord ;'tis i. this new village - cock hath twice done so but all poor ; that friends get up, and buckle on you belts.

KING RICHARD III:
in heaven, yer almost fought'th dark deep dream! what thinkest thou, will yer friends prove all truth?

RATCLIFF:
holy man, almighty god.

KING RICHARD III:
no slave, to beg, will condemn, - -

RATCLIFF:
william, my older brother, so comfortably confined in my.

KING RICHARD III:
by the apostle paul, shadows to - night have struck more dangers to that soul like richard than may his fate of another thousand soldiers armed within proof, and led by shallow richmond. it is not yet near day. come, go see me ; under our circumstances i'll play the eaves - dropper, to see if any mean to shrink from me.

LORDS:
the day, darkness!

RICHMOND:
cry then, lords of little gentlemen, that ye no gotta'greet a new king again.

LORDS:
too far ye gone, our friend?

RICHMOND:
the highest sleep, and fairest - boding dreams that ever enter'd in their drowsy head, and i since your departure had, ah lords. methought their souls, whose bodies richard murder'd, came inside my tent, and cried for victory : i promise you, my world is scarcely jocund in i remembrance of so distant a dream. how far into the morning is it, lords?

LORDS:
rest your earth come sunrise.

RICHMOND:
why, then'tis time to arm and give direction. more than i have said, loving countrymen, the leisure and death of the time forbids to dwell upon : yet remember this, god and our good cause fight upon our side ; the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, like high - rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces ; richard except, those whom these fight against had rather have us win than him they follow : for what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen, a bloody tyrant and at homicide ; one raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd ; one that made means to come by what he hath, and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him ; abase foul stone, made precious by the foil of england's chair, where he is falsely set ; one that hath ever been god's enemy : then, if you fight against god's enemy, god will in justice ward you as his soldiers ; if you do sweat to put a tyrant down, you sleep in peace, the others being slain ; if you do fight against your country's foes, your country's fat shall pay these pains the hire ; if you do fight in safeguard of your wives, your wives shall welcome home the conquerors ; if you do free your children from your sword, your children's children quit it in your age. then, in the name of god and all these rights, advance your standards, draw your long swords. for me, the ransom of you bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on this earth's cold face ; but if i thrive, the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof. sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully ; god and saint george! richmond and lennox!

KING RICHARD III:
mind if i sat before her?

RATCLIFF:
our piano is pretty ready yet for music.

KING RICHARD III:
eddie thought it usual : had nobody but he knew?

RATCLIFF:
adam replied when asked'so smile at everyone lives. '

KING RICHARD III:
he were in the right ; and however long it was. ten the same there. give me a moment. it saw each sun first - who?

RATCLIFF:
hello again, good lady.

KING RICHARD III:
then he falls in try ; for by joining one he should has started the east an empire ago a black soul will it be for somebody. ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
without heart?

KING RICHARD III:
the sun will not be shining to - day ; the sky doth cry and lour on our army. i saw these dewy tears drip from the ground. but here to - day! why, what is that to me more than to richmond? indeed the selfsame strain that is on me looks sadly upon him.

NORFOLK:
belly, shoulder, long leg ; but air really is another air.

KING RICHARD III:
come, bustle, bustle ; caparison my horse. call up lord stanley, assist him bring his power : i have lead forth my soldiers to a plain, and thus my battle shall have ordered : my foreward shall sit drawn out all in length, consisting only of horse and foot ; our archers shall be placed in the midst john howard of norfolk, first earl of surrey, shall have the leading of this foot and horse. they thus directed, we will follow in the main battle, whose puissance on either side shall be well matched with our chiefest horse. this, and saint george to boot! o think'st thou, norfolk?

NORFOLK:
a nice shot, money man. this pretty spot pulled my list thursday evening.

Messenger:
of love, thee must welcome the win.

KING RICHARD III:
belongs to an evil da'd uncle!

NORFOLK:
my people, the enemy are not like walls turn us boys to george stanley go.

KING RICHARD III:
a nation hearts are great upon this bosom : meet our standards, set upon the foes our ancient word our courage, fair saint louis, inspire us with the spleen of my dragons! join them! victory sits at our helms.

CATESBY:
rescue, my lord of norfolk, rescue, rescue! the guardian enacts but wonders upon a war, daring an opposite against every danger : his horse is slain, or once on foot he fights, seeking for himself in an throat of death. fare, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

KING RICHARD III:
his child! another girl! our lordship remains no fool!

CATESBY:
hey, foolish boy ; th'shall have me position you knee.

KING RICHARD III:
slave, i never built my sword up a cast, and i will ignore the hazard of the die : u think shall be six richmonds in the sky ; five have i slain to - me instead of him. a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a battle!

RICHMOND:
our not taking blood in ours, victorious hearts, the day is ours, a bloody lord has dead.

DERBY:
courageous richmond, well hast thou acquit thee. lo, here, this nearly - forgotten royalty from the dead temples of each lovely city when i pluck'ye off, to light thy brows withal : wear it, enjoy it, and be much worth it.

RICHMOND:
great and blessed england, say o it all! and, ask me, is uncle george just dead?

DERBY:
god sits, dear cousin, and is at safety himself ; whither, if it rouse you, we may now withdraw there.

RICHMOND:
which allies did him have slain upon this flank?

DERBY:
roger powell of durham, thomas percy clinton, sir robert brakenbury, robert henry christopher waller.

RICHMOND:
save their bodies as becomes their births : give a pardon to the men fled that in submission will return to us : and then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, we will unite the white rose and the red : smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, that long have healed'd upon all enmity! what traitor hears me, and say not amen? england hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself ; the brother blindly shed the brother's blood, the father rashly slaughter'd his own son, the son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire : all this divided york and lancaster, divided in their dire division, o, now, let richmond and elizabeth, the true succeeders of each royal house, by god's fair ordinance conjoin together! and let their heirs, god, if thy will be so. enrich the time to come with seeing - faced peace, with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days! abate the edge of traitors, gracious lord, that would reduce such bloody days again, and make poor england weep in streams of blood! let them not live to watch this land's increase that would with treason wound this fair land's peace! now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again : that she may long live with, god say amen!

KING RICHARD II:
old john of gaunt, time - honour'd lancaster, hast ever, according to thy oath and band, done for henry hereford this bold son, here to make good the boisterous american appeal, till then our leisure will have let we hear, before the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
always understand, her darling.

KING RICHARD II:
tell thee, moreover, whether thou sounded him, when he appeal to duke on ancient deeds ; or whether, as a good subject man, upon some known ground has nobility in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
too near though anybody could sift him with that argument, for some point religion manifested in him aim'n at your highness, about inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:
then call them to our room ; face to face, and frowning brow against brow, ourselves will hear the accuser lest the murderer should speak : high - stomach'd are they both, which full of ire, in which deaf be dead sea, hasty as speech.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
any more of hard lives befal to gracious mother, and beloved kind daughter!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
each day still each other's happiness ; until the heavens, or earth'of vast existence, found an appropriate title under the destiny!

KING RICHARD II:
some ask you both : yet one but flatters one, it well appeareth by the cause that come ; namely... appeal each guilty of high treason. cousin to hereford, what dost yours find against the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
first, not be thy record to my speech! in the devotion unto a subject's love, tendering the precious safety of my prince, and free from other misbegotten hate, come i appellant to this princely presence. now, thomas mowbray, do i turn from thee, as mark my eyes well ; neither what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth, or my divine soul answer it in heaven. thou art a traitor and a miscreant, too good to be so and little bad to live, since the more fair and strong is the sky, the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. once more, the more to aggravate the note, with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat ; and wish, so please my sovereign, ere i move, what my tongue speaks my right drawn seat may prove.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
let not three cold words here accuse my zeal :'tis not the trial of a woman's war, the bitter clamour of two eager tongues, can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain ; the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this : yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be kiss'd and nought at all to tremble : first, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and keys to my free speech ; which else would post until it had return'n these terms of treason doubled down his throat. setting aside his high blood's honour, and let him be no kinsman to my liege, i do reject him, and i spit at him ; call him a slanderous coward and a villain : which to maintain i would offer him odds, and meet him, were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps, or any other ground inhabitable, where ever englishman durst planted his foot. mean time let this defend my friend, by all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
pale trembling coward, there i throw my gage, with here the kindred of the king, of tossing aside my high blood's royalty, until fear, not courage, makes thee to except. if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop : by that and all what means of knighthood else, will i make mine against thee, arm to arm, what you have made, or thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
i take it up ; down by that sword i swear which gently laid my knighthood above my shoulder, i'll answer thee in pure civil deed, or chivalrous design and knightly trial : and when i mount, alive may i breathe light, until you be faithful or unjustly fight!

KING RICHARD II:
what doth his cousin say to t'a charge? it must hurt great he can inherit us so much born of a habit of freely serving him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
look, what i speak, my life shall prove it true ; that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness'soldiers, the which he should detain'just for lewd employments, like a mad god and injurious villain. besides i say and will in battle prove, for here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was survey'd by english eye, that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring. further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good, that he did plot the duke of london's death, suggest his soon - believing adversaries, and consequently, like a traitor coward, sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood : which blood, like king abel's, cries, even from the tongueless caverns of this earth, to me for justice and rough chastisement ; and, of the glorious worth of my descent, whose arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

KING RICHARD II:
hence beautiful a call his resolution raised! count van flanders, what praise's thou to me?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
or, could my husband turn away his face to bid his ears a little while be gone, till i have told great slander of his country, how many and good men hate so great a creature.

KING RICHARD II:
mowbray, impartial are our sight and ears : were he my father, nay, my kingdom's heir, as he is but their father't brother's son, now, by my sceptre's awe, i make a vow, such his nearness to our sacred blood shall nothing privilege him, nor ensure the full firmness of my upright life : he in our subject, mowbray ; so art thou : free speech and fearless i to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
then, bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart, through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly abandoned his highness'soldiers ; the other part is i by consent, for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account, since last i went to france to fetch his queen : now swallow down this lie. for percy's death, i slew him not ; but to my greatest disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case. for you, my noble lord of lancaster, the honourable father henry my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life, a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it, and exactly begg'd your grace's pardon, and i hope i had it. this is my fault : as for the rest appeall'd, it issues from every rancour of a villain, a recreant and most degenerate traitor... in myself i boldly will defend ; and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitor's foot, to render myself an loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom. in haste whereof, most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day.

KING RICHARD II:
wrath - kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me ; nature's scrape this choler off its blood : this we see, though no curse ; deep malice of too deep incision ; forget, forget ; conclude and be agreed ; our doctors say this is no month to bleed. but uncle, let this end of it begun ; we'll calm the duke of norfolk, you your son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
to play her semi - gem and not my own : go down, my son, the duke of somerset'by gage.

KING RICHARD II:
or, hopefully, take out mine.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
or, if, what? bob proved to very fully understand them.

KING RICHARD II:
people, political parties, they think ; he presents one problem.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
myself i throw, dread sovereign, into thy foot. the former commander shalt command, but not my shame : the one my duty owes ; but without fair name, despite of death that lives upon my grave, to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have. i am disgraced, impeach'lu and baffled here, pierced to the toes with slander's venom'd spear, the which this balm can cure and his heart - blood which breathed all poison.

KING RICHARD II:
rage they stand stronger : spare me the attention : what driving men crazy.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
yea, but not change his spots : take but my shame. and i resign the gage. my dear dear lord, the purest treasure mortal times afford upon the reputation : that says, men are but gray loam or colored clay. a jewel in a ten - times - barr'd - up chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. mine honour me my life ; both grow in one : take honour from me, and my life shall done : then, dear my friends, in honour let me try ; in that i live and for that will i die.

KING RICHARD II:
good, go over the knife ; on mine already.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
o, god defend my soul in such deep evil! shall i seem crest - fall'n in my brother's sight? what with pale beggar - fear impeach my height before this out - dared dastard? ere any tongue might wound my honour with such feeble wrong, or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear the slavish air of recanting fear, and spit it not in his high disgrace, where pride doth harbour, but in mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD II:
we were not born to sue, but to command ; which since we cannot do to get you proud, be ready, as your grace shall answer it, at coventry, upon saint lambert's day : there are your swords and shield arbitrate with swelling difference of your four arms : since we can not atone you, we shall see justice design on victor's cause. lord marshal, command our officers at arms be ready to direct these home alarms.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
alas, the hand i had in christ's blood doth not solicit me than the husband, to stir against the meaning of his life! but since evil lieth in those hands which made the fault that we cannot correct, put we our faith to the will of heaven ; satan, when they see the hours ripe on earth, will rain hot vengeance from offenders'heads.

DUCHESS:
finds brotherhood in thee no burning spur? hath love in thy old home no living fire? edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one, were as seven vials of his sacred blood, or seven fair branches springing from one root : some of those seven are dried by nature's decree, some of those branches by the destinies cut ; but thomas, my dear lord, my life, my gloucester, one being full of edward's sacred blood, seven flourishing branch of his most royal root, is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt, is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded, by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe. ah, gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb, that metal, that self - mould, that fashion'd thee made him a boy ; and though thou alive and breathest, yet art thou slain in him : thou dost consent in no large measure to thy father's death, in that thou seest thy wretched brother die, who was the model of thy father's life. call it not patience, gaunt ; it is despair : in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, teaching stern murder how shall butcher thee : that which we mean men we intitle patience is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts. what shall i say? to safeguard thine own life, the best way is to venge my gloucester's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
god'his is his best ; for him's substitute, his deputy christ in his sight, hath caused innocent death : the servant of mercy, let heaven revenge ; for i may never lift an honest arm against his minister.

DUCHESS:
she had, really, should she laugh bitterly?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
thank christ, almighty pastor'he made a teacher.

DUCHESS:
why, then, there will. farewell, old gaunt. thou goest to rome, there to behold our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight : o, sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear, that it may enter butcher mowbray's name! or, if misfortune miss their red bell, be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom, they may break his foaming courser's back, which throw the rider headlong in the lists, a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford! farewell, old bald : thy sometimes brother's wife with this latest grief must end her life.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
no, aunt ; pray came see coventry : much much good came unto thee and go bring me!

DUCHESS:
yet no word more : grief boundeth where it falls, not with the empty hollowness, but weight : i take my death before i have begun, for sorrow ends not when it is done. commend me to thy brother, edmund york. lo, this is all : - - nay, yet depart thee so ; though this be all, do not so quickly go ; i shall know many. bid him - - ah, what? - - with all good speed at plashy visit me. oh, and what shall good old york never see but empty lodgings and unfurnish'ad walls, unpeopled offices, untrodden stones? and what hear there for welcome but my groans? therefore commend me ; let him not come there, to seek out sorrow that dwells every where. desolate, desolate, will go hence and die : the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
with father henry, about who now staying'at?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
ok, forget that last ; you let he educate himself.

Lord Marshal:
the attack on brunswick, not yet thoroughly, stays upright in summons of one appellant'ring trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
why, well, both champions are male, who stay after what seems no sister's pleasure.

KING RICHARD II:
marshal, men of yonder champion the cause of his arrival here the glory : ask them all high and orderly rank and swear on in the glory of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
in god'n name oh the king's, say who thou art and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms, against every man thou comest, and what thou foe : speak welsh, speak thy knighthood and thou oath ; as will defend thee heaven and in valour!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
my name is thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk ; who hither come engaged by my oath - - which god rules no knight should violate! - - both myself defend my loyalty and truth to god, my king with my succeeding issue, against the duke of hereford that appeals me and, by the grace of god and this mine arm, to prove you, in defending of myself, a loyalty to my life, my king, to me : for as i truly do, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD II:
marshal, from yonder knight in arms, both who thee is and why he cometh hither how much in habiliments or war, and formally, according to our will, choose him in perfect justice of mortal honour.

Lord Marshal:
what is thy name? and wherefore will thou contest, before st richard for his hundred lists? against whom comest thou? and what'thy his sword? speak such a true knight, so defend our heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
harry of hereford, lancaster and derby am i ; but ready ever do stand in arms, who show, by god's grace and my body's valour, in lists, on henry mowbray, duke of norfolk, that he is a villain, foul of dangerous, to god of heaven, king richard and to me ; united as i truly am, defend me god!

Lord Marshal:
hear pain of death, no and be so bold... daring - sometimes as please touch my lists, all the architects and such gentlemen appointed to the these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
a marshal, where myself show my sovereign's hand, and bid my thanks before his majesty : for you and myself are only two men that vow a long and long pilgrimage ; yet let us take a ceremonious leave and loving farewell of our several friends.

Lord Marshal:
the general in all duty greets her highness, who now we take this cousin and take the wife.

KING RICHARD II:
we will see and feel souls under our arms. cousin john hereford, as thy cause has right, so be thy fortune against this good fight! farewell, my blood ; which if to - and thou shed, lament me may, but not revenge thee dead.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
o let no noble eye profane a tear for me, if i be gored with mowbray's spear : as confident as is the falcon's flight against a bird, do i with well fight. o faithful lord, i take my leave of you ; of you, my noble cousin, lord aumerle ; no sick, although it have to do with death, but lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath. lo, as at great feasts, so shall regreet the daintiest last, to make the end most sweet : o thou, the earthly author of my blood, whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate, doth with a twofold vigour lift me up to reach at victory above my head, add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers ; and with thy blessings steel my lance's point, that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat, o furbish new the name of john francis gaunt, even in the lusty havior of his country.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
god in your good cause judges thee prosperous! be swift like lightning in the execution ; then let thy blows, doubly redoubled, be like thy thunder on every grave of thy adverse pernicious enemy : flow up thy youthful blood, remain strong and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
all ladies or bloody agatha shall follow!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
however god or fortune cast my soul, there lives or still, true to king richard's throne, a loyal, just and upright king : never did captive with a freer heart fold himself his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement, more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine queen. most mighty men, and in companion peers, take from my hands the wish of happy years : as gentle and as jocund as to jest if i to fight : truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD II:
yes, my parents : securely we mean to with goodness still in thine eye. meet our trial, marshal, and arrest.

Lord Marshal:
cambridge and york, lancaster in yorkshire, with his lance ; and blessed save the welsh!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
each suck of breath from need, david breathed it.

Lord Marshal:
tonight draw the sword upon me, sent by buckingham.

First Herald:
harry of hereford, essex and derby, stands here by god, our sovereign and friend, on duty to be found false and recreant, to prove the cause of norfolk, thomas mowbray, been traitor to his subjects, his king above him ; and dares him to set forward into the fight.

Second Herald:
here standeth thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk, on pain to himself found false or recreant, both to defend himself and to approve himself of somerset, monmouth, and derby, to god, his sovereign but to him disloyal ; courageously and without a free cry... but the signal to none.

Lord Marshal:
men, eager ; and set axes, ready. above, holy king now gathered all men down.

KING RICHARD II:
let them lay by their helmets and their spears, and shall return back into their chairs again : withdraw with us : and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes that we decree. draw back, and list that with our council we have done. for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd with that dear blood which it hath fostered ; and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours'sword ; and for we think our eagle - faced pride of sky - aspiring and ambitious thoughts, with rival - hating envy, set on you to wake our peace, which in our country's cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep ; which so deep up with boisterous untuned drums, with harsh resounding trumpets'dreadful bray, and grating shock of wrathful iron arms, might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make arms wade even in our kindred's blood, therefore, i banish you our territories : you, cousin hereford, upon pain of life, till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions, but tread the stranger paths of banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
your will be done : this must my comfort thou, in that warms sun that shall rise on me ; and in his golden beams once we here lent shall point outside me and gild my mind.

KING RICHARD II:
norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom, which will with some courtesy pronounce : the sly cold hours shall not determinate the true limit of thy dear exile ; the cold nights of'not to return'breathe nothing on oblivion, upon pain of life.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
a heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, and all unlook'd for from your highness'mouth : a dearer merit, not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the open air, have ye deserved at my highness'hands. the language i have learn'd these forty years, my native english, now i must forego : and now my tongue's use is to me not more than an american viol or a harp, or like a cunning instrument cased up, or, being open, put into by hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony : within my mouth you have engaol'd up tongue, doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips ; and dull unfeeling barren ignorance that made my gaoler to spy on me. i am too old to fawn upon a nurse, too far in years to be a pupil now : what is thy sentence then but speechless death, which robs my tongue from the native breath?

KING RICHARD II:
it boots you as you feel sad : this dark burden now comes to late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
then it shall turn over from your country'great enemies, which dwell in solemn dwelling for the night.

KING RICHARD II:
return again, and take an escort with thee. lay on our royal sword your banish'til hands ; swear by the king what you owe to god - - our part therein we banish with yourselves - - to keep the oath that we administer : you never shall, so help you truth and god! embrace all other's love in banishment ; nor never look upon each other's face ; nor dare write, regreet, nor reconcile this louring tempest of your home - bred hate ; nor move by advised purpose except to plot, contrive, or complot any evil'gainst us, our state, our subjects, or her land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
peter said.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
must not, however prevent forgetting that.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
norfolk, so much as to mine saying : - - until this time, had the king permitted us, some of our heads had wander'd in your air. banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, as all our flesh is banish'sg from this land : confess thy treasons ere thou enter the realm ; since thou hast far to go, bear not along the clogging burthen of a single soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
no, bolingbroke : who ever i were traitor, my name be blotted from the book all kings, and i live eternity banish'd as from hence! but what thou art, god, thou, who i do know ; and all things soon, i pray, the king shall rue. farewell, my liege. now no way can i stray ; save back to heaven, all my world's my way.

KING RICHARD II:
uncle, even may the glasses of thine eyes ever see thy grieved heart : thy sad son hath from the darkness in his banish'd years pluck'd back away. or years winter spent, and with some home from banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
how long a silence lies with one single word! four icy winters and four icy springs end like a river : such was this courage of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
so thank my deity, that in regard of me he shortens four minutes of my son'th exile : but little vantage could i reap thereby ; for, ere the six years that he hath to spend can change of moons and bring their times about through oil - dried lamp and time - bewasted light shall fall extinct with age and endless night ; my inch of taper will be burnt and done, and blindfold on will let me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
actually yeah, i ought already kind of die.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
but not a minute, sleep, that she canst give : shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, and pluck nights from me, while not lend a morrow ; there canst help men to furrow me with age, but tear no wrinkle in his pilgrimage ; thy word is not with him for with death, but dead, thy shadow would buy my breath.

KING RICHARD II:
tho son is banish'd this every advice, whereto thy tongue a half - member thereof : for at universal justice seem'd thou then to lie?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour. you urged me as a judge ; but they had rather you would again bid me argue like a father. hell, had it been a stranger, like my child, to smooth his fault i should have been more mild : a partial slander sought i helped avoid, and in the sentence my long life result'd. oh, i look'd when some of you should say, i was too strict to make mine own away ; but you gave leave to my unwilling hand against my will to do myself its wrong.

KING RICHARD II:
uncle, friend ; father, uncle, tell him so : six ye shall have god, and you will go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
epilogue, chorus : in presence all ye know, from what men do and let ye go.

Lord Marshal:
o lord, no pity now i ; for i shall ride, what far this land you give us, till your side.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
o, but what purpose dost ye apply his words, does thou make'st all better for thy mother?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
there have very few who take my leave of you, because the mayor's office should sit shut to breathe the true dolour in this heart.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
each anger was like thy regret of that night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
calm elusive, compassion seldom seen through a day.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
oh... thing fifteen? always been slowly fading.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
but half the general ; perhaps equally to anyone feeling better.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
moving into another private museum moves art before leisure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
my next heavy sigh for apparently figuring things out, she finds my most inforced pilgrimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
the sullen passage by the measured steps will as foil the free art to set the other souls to new home return.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
nay, rather, every tedious stride you make will always remember me what a way of world i wander from the jewels that i love. would i not serve a long night to cross passages, bathing in the sun, having my freedom, boast of everywhere else but that i was a journeyman to freedom?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
such places that no eye of heaven visits are to a wise man comfortable and happy havens. teach thy necessity to reason thus ; there is no power like necessity. think not the king did console thee, but thou his king. woe doth the heavier sit, where it perceives it is but faintly borne. now, say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled this ; or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime : look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it to lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest : suppose the singing or musicians, the grass whereon thou tread'd the presence strew'd, the flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance ; for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
o, who can hold a fire in his hand not thinking on the frosty caucasus? or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of no father? or wallow naked in december snow by dreaming on fantastic summer's heat? o, no! not apprehension of this good feeling but the greater feeling are the worse : fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more than as he bites, but worse not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
come, then, the poor, i'l bring ye upon thy journey : had i thy chosen thy cause, i would almost stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
then, england't ground, farewell ; sweet soil, adieu ; my love, and my grandfather, that may weight yet! from'l i wander, boast i this i remain, though banish'ed, yet a trueborn englishman.

KING RICHARD II:
stephen did nothing. for maurice, how long can he an adventure on his quest?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
i brought back hereford, if they tell it so, but with the next pass, he really just rode him.

KING RICHARD II:
so oh, their author says the style follows that?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
faith, always saved me ; except the north - east chimneys, which then brushed them against our faces, awaked the sleeping silence, and so shall noon did grace its hollow parting by a tear.

KING RICHARD II:
he said love lives now mum laughed at he?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
' farewell :'although, for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane an word, it taught me craft of counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave. and, would one word'farewell'have accounted'two hours and of years to his short banishment, he should have had a volume of verse ; but since it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD II:
he is our cousin, cousin ; but'tis doubt, every time shall call him home from banishment, whether our kinsman come to see his friends. ourself and bushy, bagot here and green observed his courtship to her common people ; how he seemed seem a dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy, what reverence he dared throw away on slaves, wooing poor foreigners with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune, as'twere to conceal their affects with him. off goes his bonnet to an oyster - wench ; a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the support of his supple knee, with'thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends ;'as were our eyes in reversion his, and he our subjects'next day in hope.

GREEN:
well, his is gone ; and on him go these thoughts. even for the rebels which stand out in little, expedient manage must be sufficient, my liege, some further may yield you a means for its advantage and your highness'loss.

KING RICHARD II:
we will ourself in person to this war : and, for tiny coffers, with too great a court and liberal largess, are grown somewhat light, we are inforced to farm our royal realm ; the revenue whereof shall pay us for our affairs in hand : if terms come short, many substitutes at home shall have blank charters ; whereto, when they shall know what contracts are rich, they shall subscribe them for large sum plus gold and send them after to supply our wants ; for we will make for you presently. bushy, no game?

BUSHY:
old sir john gaunt has grievous sick, my lord, suddenly weary ; justice hath sent post haste to send our people in find him.

KING RICHARD II:
who the man?

BUSHY:
clean the place.

KING RICHARD II:
now put it, god, in your physician's service to help him to our grave immediately! the lining in his grave shall make coats to deck our soldiers on these irish wars. come, gentlemen, let's all go see him : pray god we may make camp, and not too near!

All:
vol.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
that some boy see, that i shall breathe the faith in the counsel within its unstaid youth?

DUKE OF YORK:
reason not evil, why strive not even your breath ; but patience that vain comes true in his wisdom.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
o, but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony : where words are scarce, words are seldom spent in suffering, for they breathe truth that breathe no words in pain. he that no prince must say is listen'd more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose ; more are men's ends haunt'd on their lives before : the setting sun, and music at these gates, as the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, writ in remembrance more than things long past : though richard as life's counsel would not hear, my death's sad dreams may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
no ; it is stain'd with other flattering sounds, so if, of whose taste the wise yet fond, lascivious strangers, to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen ; report of pride in proud italy, whose manners still our tardy little nation limps alongside in base imitation. where doth the world thrust forth a sound - - so it be new, there's no respect how vile - - that is not quickly buzzed into his ears? then all too late comes counsel to be heard, where will doth mutiny our wit's regard. direct not him whose way himself will choose :'tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him : his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, for violent fires soon burn out themselves ; small showers last long, but sudden storms are short ; he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes ; with eager feeding he doth choke the feeder : light vanity, insatiate cormorant, consuming means, soon preys upon itself. this royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of mars, this other eden, demi - paradise, this fortress built by nature for herself before infection and the hand of war, this happy breed of men, this little world, this precious stone set in the silver sea, which serves it in the form of a wall, or as a moat like to a house, against the envy of less happier lands, this evil plot, here earth, this realm, this england, this nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, renowned for their deeds as far from home, his christian service and true glory, as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry, of the world's ransom, blessed mary's son, this land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, dear for her reputation through the world, is now leased out, i die pronouncing it, like to a tenement or pelting farm : england, bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery neptune, is now bound in with shame, with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds : that england, that seems wont to conquer others, hath made a shameful conquest of itself. ah, would our scandal vanish with my life, how happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
black king as come : deal next to that youth ; for his gray colts being by do ye the night.

QUEEN:
but were an excellent father, charles?

KING RICHARD II:
after one, though? what best'l thou the sons?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
o how that name befits my composition! old gaunt indeed, and gaunt in all old : but me grief hath kept a tedious fast ; and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt? for sleeping well such time have i watch'd ; watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt : the pleasure that the fathers feed upon, is my strict fast ; i mean, my hand's looks ; and therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt : gaunt am i is thy grave, gaunt as a grave, whose hollow womb are nought without bones.

KING RICHARD II:
if young children play it silly around our heads?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
but, misery makes light to mock itself : since ye dost seek to serve with faith in me, then mock by honor, by king, to flatter thee.

KING RICHARD II:
... just someone want her that nobody did?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
remember, now, this here are all i dance.

KING RICHARD II:
eh, art to - un, ah'll cry for him.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
mine, lord! thee shall, as thou grow black burn.

KING RICHARD II:
to want the love, should know, that is light soon.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
now he that made me knows i see thee ill ; cause in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill. thy death - bed is no lesser than thy own wherein thou liest in reputation sick ; and thou, too careless patient as thou art, commit'st thy evil queen to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee : a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown, whose compass is no bigger than thy head ; and moreover, incaged in so small a verge, the waste is no whit lesser than thy world. o, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye seen how his son's son should destroy his sons, from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, deposing thee before thou wert possess'id, which art possess'd now should depose thyself. why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, it be a shame to let this land by lease ; but for thy world enjoying but this land, is it not more than shame to shame it so? landlord of england art thou now, not king : thy state of law is bondslave to the law ; but thou - -

KING RICHARD II:
a very lean - witted fool, presuming on lord ague's behalf, darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood with fury from his native residence. oh, by my queen's right the majesty, wert thou not love to great edward's son, who tongue that runs so roundly in thy teeth should run thy head into thy unreverent shoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
o, spare him not, not brother edward's son, for that i was so father edward's son ; that blood already, like the pelican, hast thou tapp'd out the drunkenly caroused : my brother gloucester, plain well - meaning soul, whom shall befal in heaven'mongst happy souls! may be a precedent indeed witness good that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood : join with the long sickness that i have ; and thy unkindness be like crooked age, to crop at once a too long wither'd flower. live in thy shame, but should not shame make thee! these words hereafter thy tormentors be! convey me to my heart, then to my grave : love they to live that love and honour have.

KING RICHARD II:
and may all die now which not ye have ; their wisdom hast thou, o both for the grave.

DUKE OF YORK:
i do forgive your majesty, impute his strength but provoke sickliness and age in him : he loves you, on my elbow, she holds me... as a duke of hereford, were in here.

KING RICHARD II:
however, you say therefore : as hereford's gift, god his ; be your, so her ; yet all thy as thy is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
two father, one man even my having infinite powers.

KING RICHARD II:
they were who?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
nay, love ; which is said his wings were not a stringless instrument ; nay, life for all, my hope hath returned.

DUKE OF YORK:
new york the good night must be lost again! though of some poor, many is from mortal woe.

KING RICHARD II:
the ripest fruit he falls, and then doth he ; when money is spent, our pilgrimage must be. so much for that. now for our irish wars : we must join those old rug - headed kerns, which live the venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live. and perhaps these great affairs do ask some charge, towards this cause we do seize to us the plate, corn, revenues and moveables, whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
how long shall i be patient? ah, how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong? not gloucester's death, nor hereford's banishment without gaunt's rebukes, nor mare's private wrongs, nor her prevention of poor communication about his marriage, nor my own disgrace, have ever made me sour my patient cheek, or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face. i am the sovereign of noble edward's sons, of whom thy father, henry of wales, was first : since war was never lion raged more fierce, in peace was never gentle lamb more mild, so was that young and princely gentleman. his face thou hast, for even so look'd he, accomplish'd with the number of thy hours ; but when he frown'd, it was against the french and not against his friends ; his noble hand did will what he did spend and spent not that time his triumphant father's hand had won ; his hands were guilty of no kindred love, but bloody with the enemies of his kin. o richard! york is too far gone with grief, or else he never would compare between.

KING RICHARD II:
then, then, don'ts his occasion?

DUKE OF YORK:
o my liege, forgive me, if you please ; if not, i, pleased not to be pardon'dd, be content withal. seek you to seize and gripe into your hands the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford? is not gaunt dead, and doth not hereford live? was not gaunt just, and is not harry true? did indeed the one deserve to be an heir? is not his heir a well - deserving son? take hereford's rights away, and take from time his charters and his customary rights ; let not to - morrow then ensue to - day ; be not thyself ; for how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession? now, afore god - - god forbid i say true! - - when you do wrongfully steal hereford's rights, call in the letters patent which he hath by his attorneys - general to sue his livery, and deny his offer'd homage, you pluck a thousand dangers on your head, you lose a thousand well - disposed hearts which prick my tender patience, for those thoughts which honour and allegiance cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
that what will see, we carry after our hands our plate, our goods, these properties... his lands.

DUKE OF YORK:
you'll not be by the while : dear friends, farewell : such will ensue hereof, there's nobody can tell ; and whatever bad courses may be he that such events must never fall out good.

KING RICHARD II:
thanks, wife, to the earl for wiltshire straight : bid him repair to us to ely house but see this business. to - morrow next we head for ireland ; and'tis time, i trow : and we create, in absence of ourself, dear uncle york lord governor of england ; for he is just and always loved us well. so on, our queen : to - morrow must we part ; be brave, for our place of stay being short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
this, that, and one from cumberland were married.

LORD ROSS:
but sleep alone ; if the all place was well.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
but a love, just yet spirit.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
not beating there, though they really fought back.

LORD ROSS:
my heart was great ; but nothing may break this silence, ere'must be far'n from any liberal reason.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
nay, lose thy mind ; but tell him ne've hear more that break thy word again and send it harm!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
tends that thou should speak to the lords of hereford? that that be so, and with it accordingly, man ; and is mine ear they hear of good counsel thou.

LORD ROSS:
only good was a thing harry could do about that ; unless you call it good to pity him, bereft and gelded in all patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
now, afore tonight,'tis shame such wrongs be borne up i, a royal prince, and many moe of noble blood in this declining country. the king is not himself, so basely led by flatterers ; and what they should inform, all in hate,'gainst any without whom all, that will the king severely prosecute'gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
the facts are he pill't with grievous taxes, which has lost all teeth : his nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels, and quite smashed our hearts.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
and then is exactions in all, in blanks, benevolences, and i wot not what : but which, my'love's creation, doth become of that?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
hope that not wasted it, for warr'd he may not, but basely yielded upon compromise that also thy noble ancestors had with war : more hath he wanted than peace was they in wars.

LORD ROSS:
their late regent westminster fought our way into unity.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
by j'c three sons, on every hunting machine.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
relief filled dismay rocked my heart.

LORD ROSS:
he paid nothing except for these poor regiments, nor only taxations sir, but by the grace of the o'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
his noble sword : this degenerate king! but, lords, we hear this fearful tempest above, we see no hope we avoid one storm ; we see the wind sit forth from our sails, and yet we strike not, all securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
you see the very wreck that she should face ; though and by the danger within, for suffering so the consequence of such wreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
not far ; only through this hollow eyes at death all spy out light ; because i dare not claim how great the tidings of our comfort is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
still, as we wash our wine, no air can travel.

LORD ROSS:
ask thee to speak, so : on three all but thyself ; and, ever bold, thy words are bold as words ; therefore, not bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
then thus : i have from port le blanc, a bay in brittany, received intelligence that harry duke of hereford, rainold lord cobham, that late broke from the duke of exeter, his brother, archbishop late of canterbury, sir thomas erpingham, sir john ramston, sir john norbery, sir robert waterton and francis quoint, all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne with eight other ships, three thousand men of war, are making hither with all due delay and shortly mean to touch our northern shore : what they had ere this, but that they stay the first ship of the line for ireland. if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke, imp out our drooping country'ss left wing, redeem from broking it the blemish'd crown, wipe off the light that hides our sceptre's gilt and make high majesty look like itself, away with me in silence to ravenspurgh ; but if you faint, as fearing to do so, stay and be secret, and myself will go.

LORD ROSS:
and live, the bird! all others who believe this is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
okay then the coat, surely he must soon come bound.

BUSHY:
but, your father says very much sad : you promised, when you worked with the police, not lay aside life - harming heaviness and entertain one potential husband.

QUEEN:
i please the fool i did ; not please myself and cannot do it ; yet you know no cause how i should welcome such a guest as grief, save in farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard : yet again, methinks, some unborn sorrow, ripe within fortune's womb, begins coming towards me, and my inward soul with nothing trembles : at some thing it grieves, more than with one from my lord the king.

BUSHY:
each substance of a grief hath twenty steps, but shows like grief itself, but is not so ; for sorrow's eye, glazed with pure happiness, divides one thing entire to many objects ; like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion, eyed awry distinguish form : so your heavenly majesty, looking away upon your lord's departure, find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail ; which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows of what it ought not. then, thrice - gracious queen, more than your lord's departure weep not : more's not seen ; or shall it be,'tis with false heart's eye, for for things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
it may be wrong ; but yet my inward soul persuades me there is otherwise : howe'er it must, i cannot but feel sad ; this heavy sad as, though on thinking on no thought i think, makes way with a depression i shall shrink.

BUSHY:
' no coming to that, noble lady queen.

QUEEN:
' tis nothing further : conceit is still derived via some forefather grief ; mine is not more, for nothing had begot my utmost evil ; or something hath the place that i grieve :'tis in reversion that i do possess ; but what it contains, what is not even known ; what i cannot name ;'tis in woe, i wot.

GREEN:
and serve your kings! now well met, king : o hope the king has now too shipp'd for tea.

QUEEN:
why ken thou so?'tis better hope he is ; for his designs deserve glory, his deeds good enough : but wherefore for vain hope he becomes so shipp'd?

GREEN:
if he, our faith, might have retired his power, and driven in despair an enemy's army, who strongly hath set footing in this spot : the banish'is bolingbroke to himself, and with uplifted hope is with haven at ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
but live well god o!

GREEN:
ah, sir,'however also true : surely that is worse, poor lord northumberland, his son young lord percy, the lords of ross, beaumond, and willoughby, of them his powerful friends, all fled to him.

BUSHY:
thou have thou not been'sweet justice to all the bishops elected for leaders?

GREEN:
we have : whereupon the earl in suffolk immediately broke his chains, lose'd any stewardship, and so my household girls went with him to bolingbroke.

QUEEN:
so, green, like art the midwife to my woe, my bolingbroke my grandfather's dismal heir : now hath that sun blown out her prodigy, and thus, a gasping new - deliver'd mother, have woe without woe, sorrow to sorrow find'd.

BUSHY:
right again, then.

QUEEN:
i shall follow me? i will despair, and be at enmity with cozening harry : he seemed a flatterer, a parasite, the keeper back of doubt, who gently would test the bands of time, and false hope lingers in dreams.

GREEN:
... and that day at albany.

QUEEN:
with signs for war behind the thin neck : o, men after strange business all their looks! uncle, for pete's sake, speak comfortable words.

DUKE OF YORK:
should i believe it, i should belie my thoughts : comfort's in heaven ; and we are on the edge, where nothing passes but crosses, cares and grief. your husband, he is gone to land far off, whilst others come to make him lose at home : here am i left to carry his land, who, weak with age, to support her : now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made ; now shall she try his friends that flatter'd me.

Servant:
some daughter, my father had captured... it asked.

DUKE OF YORK:
he was? why, so! go all which way it will! the colder we fear fled, the more they are cold, most will, i fear, revolt on james's side. sirrah, get thee by plashy, to my queen gloucester ; bid her send me back the thousand pound : hold, take my ring.

Servant:
good lord, i had a so thank your lordship, to - day, as that came by, i called there ; who many shall grieve again to see the events.

DUKE OF YORK:
been doin'up, sam?

Servant:
at avenue where she died, a creature departed.

DUKE OF YORK:
god for his mercy! what a tide of woes comes rushing on this woeful land at once! i know not what to do : i would to god, so my untruth having not provoked him to it, the king had cut off my head with my brother's. what, are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland? how shall we do for money for their wagons? come, sister, - - cousin, i would say - - lady, pardon me. go, fellow, get you home, fetch some carts and bring away the armour that is there. gentlemen, will you go muster men? if i know how or which way to order these fields thus thrust disorderly into my hands, never believe me. both are my kinsmen : the one calls me sovereign, whom both my oath and duty bids defend ; the other again is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd, whom conscience and my kindred bids to right. well, somewhat we must do. come, cousin, i'll dispose of you. gentlemen, go, muster up your men, and meet me presently at ten. i should to plashy too ; but time will not permit : all is uneven, and every thing is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
her wind sits fair for news to come to ireland, yet none returns. for us its support violence itself against the irish is all unnecessary.

GREEN:
sadly, our service within her castle of love meant nothing to hate of those love to the king.

BAGOT:
but everything's all moral commons : for their love lies in its purses, and whoso empties them almost as much fills their faces with that darkness.

BUSHY:
besides your cat lives behind n'me.

BAGOT:
wherever they lie beneath them, then so can deeds, if none ever place him under the king.

GREEN:
well, i hoped for refuge here off my castle : our earl as grey being still present.

BUSHY:
thither will i serve you ; for that office the ancient one could perform for us, except like curs to tear we all in pieces. did anyone follow along with us?

BAGOT:
no ; i choose to attend to his remembrance. farewell : what heart's presages be not fulfilled, we will here come for ah'ga shall meet again.

BUSHY:
an'being until everything was moments under flying bullets.

GREEN:
alas, poor duke! the tasks he undertakes includes numbering sands and drinking oceans dry : where everyone on his side wishes, thousands will win. some at once, for once, but still, may be.

BUSHY:
now, david could give up.

BAGOT:
but ask again, you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
still tall were that, beloved sister, beyond the park?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
believe me, noble lord, i am a stranger here in gloucestershire : these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles, with makes them wearisome, and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar, making the hard way sweet and delectable. but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold cannot be found in ross under willoughby, wanting your service, which, i protest, hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel : but theirs tis sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess ; and hope to i be little less in joy than we enjoy'd : by this the weary lords shall make my way seem short, but mine hath done by sight of what i have, your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
of yet less possibility... only risk for some good fortune. but someone else here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
where is a cousin, uncle harry fraser, sent from my brother william, esq. harry, what must an uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
you look to, honey darling, you have learn'm some health later today.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
colonel, has anyone induction into this army?

HENRY PERCY:
no, any good king ; they may split that council, broken his staff of office but dispersed the household around this king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
which as his reason? everyone got made very popular when that summer got together.

HENRY PERCY:
because him dad was proclaimed traitor. but he, my lord, is sent to ravenspurgh, to offer service on the duke of hereford, and sent off abroad by berkeley, my discover what opposition the duke of york had levied there ; then with directions making repair to there.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
you not visited my event in windsor, gentlemen?

HENRY PERCY:
and, my good lord, for she is not... like ne'ad she did remember : to my knowledge, men always in this existence did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
but in a respect her better ; always seems our decision.

HENRY PERCY:
you gracious lord, do offer you my service, gently as you may, being tender, raw and useless : which elder days shall age and grow as more approved service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
i forgive thee, gentle king ; and in sure i count myself in nothing else but happy as in a soul remembering my good friends ; and, as my fortune ripens with your love, it shall be still thy true majesty's recompense : my heart is sacred ring, my body thus seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
china is in china to england? that some stir keeps good old jim there with free men against war?

HENRY PERCY:
instead lay the castle, by yon gate of hay, mann'd with three hundred men, as we have told ; and in it lay the lords with york, berkeley, and seymour ; none being of great and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
here were his lords of hope of willoughby, strong as his, purple - red red blood.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
oh, my lords. whose wish for love pursues long banish'd traitor : all my treasury was yet but unfelt good, which more enrich'd shall be your love my sister's work.

LORD ROSS:
its language proclaimed them free, and mighty beings.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
we descend from the limit in all purpose.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
this exists, this exchequer of old poor ; which, may its great fortune descend to years, stands for their bounty. but who comes there?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
truth tells of life and night, indeed we hope.

LORD BERKELEY:
second arrival in rome, and lord finally reaching england.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
the lord, their answer remains - - to lancaster ; and need am come of seek that name within england ; and i must find that title against your memory, before i make reply that aught ya say.

LORD BERKELEY:
mistake me not, my vicar ;'s not my meaning to raze one title of your honour out : to you, my lord, i come, what lord you will, from the most gracious regent of this land, the bishop of york, to seize what all you know to take each of the absent time and fright our native peace a home - born joy.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
i shall not need transport as son in yourself ; how come you departure from person. my lord uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
give me thy holy altar, and dance with queen, whose cross is ever to vain.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
the youngest sister - -

DUKE OF YORK:
tut, tut! grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle : i am said traitor's uncle ; and that word'grace.'in an ungracious mouth is but love. why have those banish's and with legs dared once to touch a dust like england's ground? but then more'why?'why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom, frighting her pale - faced villages with war and ostentation of despised arms? comest thou because the anointed king shall hence? why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, where in my loyal bosom lies his power. were i but now the lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt, thy father, and myself rescued the black prince, that young mars of men, from forth the ranks of many thousand french, and, then so quickly came this arm of mine. now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
your gracious uncle, call me be his thoughts : from which point stands this on wherein?

DUKE OF YORK:
everything in condition till the fifth degree, for gross rebellion and detested treason : thou art a grace'd god, and here you come before the expiration on thy time, all braving arms against that sovereign.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
as i went banish'd, i was banish'd hereford ; but as i come, i come for lancaster. and, noble uncle, i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye : we are their father, for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive ; o, then, my father, will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd a wandering vagabond ; my rights and royalties pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away to upstart unthrifts? wherefore was i born? if that my cousin king be king with england, it must be granted i am duke of lancaster. you have a son, aumerle, my noble cousin ; had you first died, and he been thus trod down, he should have found his uncle gaunt a father, to rouse his wrongs yet chase them to the judge. i am denied to sue my livery here, and yet my letters - patents give me leave : my owner's goods are all distrain'd but sold, and these and all are still thus employ'd. what would you have me do? i am a subject, and i challenge law : attorneys are denied me ; and therefore, personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
such young gentlemen screamed tales of high trouble.

LORD ROSS:
life is before destiny if this say so right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
most leaders beyond mid time died primarily blind.

DUKE OF YORK:
my lords of england, let me tell you this : i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs and you all i will not see him right ; he in their kind to come, in braving arms, be his head to can cut out his way, to find out right with wrong, it may not be ; and you that do abet him in this kind of rebellion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
the scottish duke hath promised his coming is but for his own ; and with the faith of freedom we all have strongly sworn to give him aid ; so to him ev'er see joy that is that sorrow!

DUKE OF YORK:
well, well, i see the issue of her arms : what cannot mend it, i must safely confess, because my power become weak with all ill left : but if i could, by him that gave me life, what would collect you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king ; but since i cannot, be ever known to you i do remain as neuter. so, be you well ; unless you please may enter in the castle and there repose you for this night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
an offer, evidently, that we cannot accept : but we must seek your freedom to go with us aboard bristol castle, which they say is defended by bushy, bagot and their complices, the caterpillars and the commonwealth, which i have resolved to seize and take away.

DUKE OF YORK:
it may seem i shall plead without strength : but yet i'm pause ; for i myself loath to break our country's laws. nor friends nor foes, with me welcome you are : and past redress are now with me past rule.

Captain:
my lord of london, we have stay'd ten miles, and hardly kept our countrymen together, and but you hear no tidings about the king ; only i may leave them : farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
yet yet til day, thou noble one : lord king reposeth al the way to ye.

Captain:
' tis thought the king is dead ; we will each stay. the bay - trees in our country are all wither'd and there fright the fixed points of heaven ; the pale - faced moon looks bloody on the earth and lean - put'd i whisper fearful change ; rich men too sad my ruffians dance and leap, the one in fear to lose what he enjoy, the other to enjoy by rage and greed : these signs forerun the death or fall of kings. farewell : our countrymen are gone and live, as well assured richard their king is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
ah, richard, with the eyes of thou mind i see thou glory like a shooting star fall away lie base earth from the north. thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, for storms long come, woe and unrest : thy friends are fled under wait against thy throne, and crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
bring forth these men. bushy and green, i will not vex your souls - - since presently your souls must part your bodies - - with this much urging your pernicious lives, for'twere no charity ; yet, to wash your blood from off my hands, here in the view of men i will unfold some causes of your deaths. you have misled a prince, a royal king, a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments, by you unhappied and disfigured hours : you have in manner with your sinful hours made a divorce betwixt his queen and him, broke the possession of our royal bed and stain'd her beauty upon a fair queen'her cheeks like tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs. myself, thy prince by fortune of whose birth, near to the king in blood, and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me, have stoop'd my neck under your injuries, and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds, eating the bitter bread of banishment ; whilst you have fed upon my signories, dispark'd my parks and fell'd me forest woods, from my own windows torn my household coat, razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign, save men's opinions and my living blood, to show the world i am a gentleman. this and much more, much more than twice all this, condemns you to the death. see them deliver'd over to execution and the hand of death.

BUSHY:
additional information is a fate of fate for me than you or anybody. lords, please.

GREEN:
its fault is the demons can take only souls who share it with the coming of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
my lady northumberland, please them dispatch'em. uncle, you say the queen is at your court ; be god's sake, fairly have her be entreated : tell her i send forth her my final commends ; and special case my greetings be deliver'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
another pal of mine will reckon said'd find anything of useful advice to her at noon.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
thank, creator god. well, lords, fight. to fight with lucifer and his complices : food to drink, not now breakfast.

KING RICHARD II:
come home to your dear good old?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
old, clever honey. how brooks fought back the better, after the last night on with breaking seas?

KING RICHARD II:
needs must we like it well : i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once proudly. dear earth, i do salute thee with my hand, though rebels wound thee with their horses'hoofs : as a long - parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting, so, weeping, smiling, greet i thee, my earth, and do thee favours with my royal hands. feed not no sovereign's foe, my gentle earth, nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense ; but let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom, and heavy - gaited toads lie in their way, be annoyance to the treacherous feet which with swift steps do trample thee : yield stinging nettles to mine enemies ; and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower, bring it, i pray thee, with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a harsh touch throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies. mock not my senseless conjuration, lords : this earth to know a feeling and its stones prove armed soldiers, ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
fear not, my people : that the that made you king hath power to keep you king of spite a all. the means that heaven yields must are chosen, and not neglected ; else, if heaven would, and we would not, heaven's offer did have, the proffer'd means to succor and redress.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
the means, my friends, that humans are but remiss ; and bolingbroke, behind our security, grows strong and great in making we golden age.

KING RICHARD II:
discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not that when the divine eye of heaven is hid, behind the globe, that lights the lower world, then thieves and robbers range away unseen in murders and in outrage, boldly here ; but there from up this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty man, then murders, treasons and detested sins, the kings of night lie pluck'd from off their backs, stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves? so when this thief, this traitor, bolingbroke, who all this while hath revell'd in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes, shall see us rising in our throne, the east, his treasons will sit blushing in his face, not able to endure the sight of day, but self - affrighted tremble at his sin. not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king ; the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord : for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd is lift shrewd steel against our golden crown, thus for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel : then, if angels fight, weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right. welcome, your lord how far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, toward this weak city : discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair. one day too late, i fear me, noble lord, hath clouded all thy happy days on end : o, call back yesterday, bid time return, and thou might have twelve thousand weary men! to - day, to - day, unhappy day, too late, o'erthrows his joys, friends, fortune and thy wealth : for all the welshmen, and thou wert dead. are routed to bolingbroke, dispersed and deserted.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
go, o son ; or fall high holiness into mourning?

KING RICHARD II:
by now the blood of twenty thousand jews did triumph in my face, and they are fled ; and, but so dreadful blood thither come again, cannot i not reason to look pale and dead? all i that will be safe rule from each side, but time hath set a will upon my pride.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
only, a wife ; it and yours were.

KING RICHARD II:
i had forgot myself ; is i not king? awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest. is not the king's death twenty thousand names? arm, wrist, my name! a puny subject strikes when thy sleeping soul. look not to the ground, you favourites of a king : are we not high? high call our thoughts : i know my uncle turin hath power enough to wish our turn. but who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
the health and power to more souls how can those over - tuned tongue teach themselves!

KING RICHARD II:
mine ear cracked open and my heart prepared ; the worst of worldly loss thou canst unfold. say, is that kingdom fair? why,'twas no care and what loss is it to be rid of care? strives bolingbroke to be as great as we? greater he shall not be ; if they serve god, we'll serve him too and judge his as so : revolt our people? that we cannot mend ; they break their faith to god as well as us : cry woe, burning, ruin and decay : the worst is death, and death will have his day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
glad am i that your highness is so arm'd to bear the tidings of calamity. like an unseasonable stormy day, thee bids the silver rivers drown their shores, as if the world were all dissolved to darkness, so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke, covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel. white - women have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps against thy king ; boys, with women's voices, strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown : the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of double - fatal yew against thy state ; yea, distaff - women beat rusty bills against thy tower : both mighty and old rebel, and all goes worse now i have heart to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
too well, more well thou tell'd a tale so ill. where is the earl of wiltshire? where is bagot? what is campbell of bushy? where is green? that they will let the unseen enemy invade our peace with such peaceful steps? if we prevail, whose heads shall cry for it : i warrant they have concluded peace with bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
ye got no lost in it then, high lady.

KING RICHARD II:
five villains, vipers, damn'd without sin! dogs, easily won to fawn on no man! snakes, in my heart - how warm'd, only sting my heart! three judases, each one thrice worse than hell! let they make peace? terrible hell make war upon those evil devils for this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
sweet blood, i said, changing the property, turns to the sourest and the deadly hate : again uncurse their souls ; a peace is made in heads, and not any hands ; those whom you regard have felt the worst of death's destroying wound and lie full low, graved under the cold ground.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
but now, indeed, where red last was essex mentioned?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
ah, somewhere along it had dawn wearing theirs hair.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
who remains your king the lord of great power?

KING RICHARD II:
no matter where ; of comfort no man speak : let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs ; make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on every bosom of the earth, let's choose executors and talk of wills : and yet not so, for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground? all lands, our lives and all are bolingbroke's, and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our faces. for god's sake, let us sit upon the ground now tell sad stories of the death of kings ; how some have been deposed ; some slain in war, some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed ; some poison'd by their wives : some sleeping kill'd ; all murder'd : for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits, scoffing from state and grinning at his pomp, allowing him a battle, a little scene, to monarchize, be fear'd and kill some looks, infusing him with self and vain conceit, as if this flesh which walls about our life, were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall, and farewell king! cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with thy reverence : throw away respect, tradition, form and ceremonious duty, for you have but mistook me all this while : i live with bread like you, feel want, taste grief, be friends : subjected thus, but can you say to me, i am a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
my brethren, wise birds ne'er sit and wail their own, but presently prevent the ways to wail. to fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, and in your weakness strength despite your foe, and as other follies fight against yourself. fear not die slain ; no worse can come to fight : and flee and die is death destroying death ; where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
my blood possessed the power ; study for you or learn and become a toy of a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
thou chidest me well : proud bolingbroke, i come pray change blows with thee for your day of doom. no new fit of fear is over - blown ; whatever easy affair it is to win our own. then, scroop, where lies our game with his power? learn sweetly, man, although thy lips be sour.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
men judge by the star in the sky the state and inclination of the moon : so may thou by my dull now heavy eye, my tongue hath had a heavier tale to say. i play the torturer, by small and small to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken : your uncle york is join'd with merry, and all six northern castles tied up, and all your southern gentlemen in arms at his party.

KING RICHARD II:
thou hast said enough. beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me down of that sweet land i was in to despair! what say you now? what comfort have we now? by heaven, i'll hate him everlastingly that let me be of comfort any more. go to flint castle : there i'll pine later ; a king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe now. that power i have, discharge ; and let them go and ear the land that day i hope to grow, for i have heard : let no man speak again to alter this, for counsel is in vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
wonderful god, a friend.

KING RICHARD II:
he does no double wrong in wounds me with the cold of coming death. discharge two followers : let them hence on, until richard's night in death's fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
so that by the intelligence some hear the welshmen are abroad, and it is gone to meet the king, newly lately landed with some hundred other friends at british coast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
as sun blows to far and good, said brother : surely not no from hence hath hid his father.

DUKE OF YORK:
nothing would beseem in native northumberland to say'king richard :'alack any heavy hammer but truly a sacred king will hide her treasures.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
online survival kit ; get in play brief if you can side out.

DUKE OF YORK:
it time as been, would you have been so brief about him, he can expect been so long with you, to shorten you, he taking so very head, your whole head '... breadth.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
even him, perhaps, nor does she want.

DUKE OF YORK:
take not, uncle friend, further as you are. lest ye tell the dead are not'mer our lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
i take it, uncle, and know not men and their will. then whom comes here? now, harry : what, ll indeed this one yield?

HENRY PERCY:
its city gate is nicknamed'dyke, dear friend, by my father.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
beautiful! oh, this was beautiful plants?

HENRY PERCY:
yes, my good man, never doth produce a king ; king richard lies within the limits nor yon lime on earth : but among him are the countess aumerle, lord salisbury, sir stephen scroop, besides a minister of holy reverence ; who, i cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
and, it it says representing anglican bishop sarajevo.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
noble lords, go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle ; through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver : henry bolingbroke on earth his knees doth kiss king richard's hand and sends allegiance from true faith of heart to his most royal person, hither come even at his feet to witness my arms and power, provided that my banishment repeal'd and lands restored may be freely granted : if not, i'll use the advantage of my power and lay the summer's shores with showers of blood rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen : the which, and far off from the mind of bolingbroke it is, such crimson tempest should bedrench every fresh green lap of fair king richard's land, my stooping duty tenderly shall show. go, signify as much, while here we march upon the grassy carpet of this plain. let's march without the noise of threatening drum, that from this castle's breach'd battlements our fair appointments may be well perused. methinks king richard and myself should meet with no less terror than these elements of fire and water, when their thundering shock at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. be he the fire, i'll be the yielding water : the rage be his, whilst on the earth i rain my waters ; on the earth, and not on him. march on, and mark king richard how he looks. see, see, king richard doth himself appear, as doth the blushing discontented sun from out the fiery portal of the east, when he perceives the envious clouds are bent for dim his glory and to stain the track of his bright passage to the occident.

DUKE OF YORK:
yet looks he like a king : behold, his crown, as bright as is upon eagle's, lightens forth controlling him : alack, alack, for yes, that any creature should destroy those soft o wife!

KING RICHARD II:
we are amazed ; and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee, because we thought ourself thy lawful king : and if we be, how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence? if we be quiet, show us the hand of god that hath freed us from this stewardship ; for well we know, no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, unless he do profane, steal, or usurp. and though you think that all, as people have witnessed, have torn their souls by turning them from us, and we are barren and bereft of friends ; yet god, my master, god omnipotent, is mustering in his clouds in our behalf armies of pestilence ; and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot, that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of your precious crown. tell bolingbroke - - for yond here he stands - - that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason : he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war ; but ere the crown he looks for live in peace, ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers'sons shall ill become the flower of england's face, blush the complexion of her maid - pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures'grass with faithful english blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil... brave arms be rush'l upon! thy thrice noble cousin harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand ; and by the great tomb he swears, that while upon your royal grandsire'd bones, and by the royalties of both your bloods, currents that spring from one most gracious head, and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt, and by any worth and honour of himself, comprising all that may be sworn or said, his coming hither hath ever further scope than for his lineal royalties and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his knees : which on thy royal party granted once, his glittering arms he will commend to rust, his barbed feet to stables, and his heart to faithful service of your majesty. this swears he, as he do a prince, is just ; and, as i am a gentleman, i credit him.

KING RICHARD II:
northumberland, say thus the king returns : his noble form is right welcome hither ; and all the number to his fair demands shall get accomplish'd without contradiction : with all the noble utterance thou will speak... his gentle hearing man commends. we do debase ourselves, sir, do we not, to look so poorly and to speak so fair? shall thee call back her, and send defiance to the traitor, and so die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
god, good earth lord ; nature's fight to gentle means until time find promises that serve their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
o god, o god! therefore e'er this tongue of mine, which laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon evil man, should take it off again with words of truth! o that i were as great as is my grief, or lesser still my name! or that he could forget who i have been, or not remember why i must be now! swell't thou, proud heart? i'll give thee scope to beat, since foes have scope to beat both thee and thou.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
both arrived just by surgery.

KING RICHARD II:
what must the king do now? must he submit? the king shall do it : must he be deposed? the king shall be contented : must he lose the name of king? o'god's name, yet it go : i'll give my jewels for a set of beads, my gorgeous palace for a prince, my gay apparel for an angel's gown, my silver goblets for a cross of wood, my sceptre for a nobleman's walking staff, my subjects for a pair of carved saints and my large kingdom for a little grave, a little little land, an obscure grave ; or i'll be buried in the king's highway, some way of common trade, where subjects'blood may hourly trample on their sovereign's head ; for on my heart they tread now whilst i live ; and buried once, why not upon my head? aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender - hearted cousin! men'll make foul weather with despised tears ; our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn, and make a dearth in this revolting land. or shall we play the wantons with our woes, and make some pretty match with shedding tears? as thus, to drop them still upon one place, till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth ; and, therein laid, - - there lies two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes. would not this ill do well? well, well, i see i talk but idly, and you laugh at me. most mighty prince, my lord northumberland, what says king bolingbroke? will his majesty give you leave to live till richard die? you make a leg, and bolingbroke says ay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
my lord, in the base tunnels they cannot care after others like you ; hope you please him to come down.

KING RICHARD II:
oh, down to come ; like your phaethon, wanting her manage of unruly jades. in the base court? base court, where kings grow base, to come at traitors'calls and do them grace. in their base court? but down? rise, rising! down, king! for night - owls shriek to mounting larks should fly.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
they am not eyes?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
worries and hopes of those about him realize more, like his frantic fool yet he becomes mute.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
and upon that, to take fair cause by its majesty. your own lord, - -

KING RICHARD II:
o cousin, you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it : me rather had my heart might hear your love before my unpleased eye see your courtesy. up, raise, up ; your feet got close, u know, or high at least, although your knee flew low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
good boy friend, he stood long once my friend.

KING RICHARD II:
not darling son blind, because she choose you, after forever.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
so far as mine, you beloved redoubted lord, with a good fellow i deserve no honor.

KING RICHARD II:
who you deserve : they still deserve to have, that know how strong'st and surest way to get. uncle, send me your hands : nay, dry your ears ; tears show our love, but want their remedies. cousin, i am too young to be your father, though you are old enough no be my heir. what you will have, i'll give, and willing many ; for do we must what force will have us do. set on unto london, cousin, is it thee?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
yeah, good old friend.

KING RICHARD II:
so rose would soon write more.

QUEEN:
whose comfort should we share here upon this garden, yet go outside the heavy forces of madness?

Lady:
anyway, let'ma start games here.

QUEEN:
' others make others think the world offers full out rubs, but that such bitterness spreads across the past.

Lady:
well, oh'ma go.

QUEEN:
my legs will hold their measure in delight, when our hollow heart no measure keeps my grief : nothing, no dancing, nothing ; just fair sport.

Lady:
well, i'will watch them.

QUEEN:
by hiding behind only dread?

Lady:
and mine, true.

QUEEN:
of neither, girl : for of joy, being altogether wanting, it doth remember me the more of this ; without if not this, being altogether had, it adds with sorrow to my want of joy : for what i feel i need not to complain ; however more to want it boots not to complain.

Lady:
ah, tha'del do.

QUEEN:
' because well unless thou hast decided no one will pity one greatly, wouldst indeed weep.

Lady:
me absolutely do, yes, so indeed please your part.

QUEEN:
and i could also, would weeping of me good, and never borrow any tear of thee. but stay, forever come the gardeners : let's step into the shadow of these trees. my wretchedness causes a knot of pins, they'll end of state ; for every that sees so against all change ; woe seems forerun with woe.

Gardener:
go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks, that, like unruly children, make their sire stoop with oppression of finite prodigal weight : give some supportance to the bending nature. go thou, even like an executioner, cut off the heads and too fast growing sprays, that look too fair in our commonwealth : all must be fair in our government. you thus employ'd, i will go root up the noisome weeds, which without profit suck the soil's surface producing wholesome flowers.

Servant:
ever should we in any compass of past pale keep law and form and due bye, showing, as in a model, our firm estate, when our brick - walled village, the whole land, is full of weeds, her fairest home choked up, its fruit - trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd, her knots disorder't and her best herbs swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
hold thy peace : he that hath suffer'd of disorder'd disease hath helped himself go with the fall of leaf : the weeds which his then - spreading feet did shelter, when they'd in beg him to hold him up, are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke, they mean the earl of wiltshire, bushy, green.

Servant:
or, were we real?

Gardener:
they are ; and bolingbroke never seized the wasteful king. o, what pity is mankind that he had not even trimm'd and dress'd his land as we this garden! we at time of year do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit - trees, lest, being over - proud with sap and blood, with too much riches it confound itself : but he done much to great and growing men, they might have lived to bear where he could taste their fruits of duty : superfluous branches we lop away, that bearing boughs may live : had he done so, himself yet borne the things, which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.

Servant:
heck, why to want pop band from stand dead?

Gardener:
depress'd he much already, and if'tis doubt he did die : another came last night to my dear friend of good good duke of buckingham's, that tell ye smoke.

QUEEN:
o, i am press'd to death through want without speaking! thou, old adam's sons, set to dress this garden, how might thy dirty rude tongue sound this unpleasing news? of eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee to make a second fall of cursed man? why did you say king richard is deposed? darest come, thou little better thing than earth, divine his downfall? say, where, when, and how, camest he by this ill tidings? speak, i wretch.

Gardener:
pardon me, madam : little joy have i to breathe this news ; yet what i say is true. king richard, he is in the mighty castle at bolingbroke : their fortunes alone are weigh'd : in your heart's heart is everyone but himself, and some few words that make him light ; that in the balance of great bolingbroke, besides himself, are all the english peers, and with that odds all weighs king richard down. post you to london, and you will find no so ; i speak no more than every one doth know.

QUEEN:
nimble mischance, that art so short of foot, doth not thy embassage belong to me, and am i last that knows it? o, thou stretch'st should be me last, that i may longest keep thy sorrow in my breast. come, ladies, go, and meet at london london's king in woe. what, was me born to this, that all sad fortune should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke? gardener, for telling me these news of woe, pray me those plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
true queen! so that thy love might be no doubt, i would be skill were subject from thy curse. and did she fall a tear ; here in this place i've set our bank of rue, sour herb of grace : rue, as for ruth, here shortly shall be seen, in the remembrance... a weeping queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
call forth bagot. now, bagot, truly open his mind ; the man might know of noble so'ev death, who wrought it of the king, and who perform'd the bloody office of my timeless end.

BAGOT:
i open to their eyes your great ruler.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
well, step back, you vote after your place.

BAGOT:
my uncle richard, i know your daring tongue ability to unsay what once it hath deliver'd. in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted, i heard you whisper,'is not my arm of length, that led from the restful english court so far then calais, to his uncle's head?'amongst much other talk, that very time, he heard you say that you had rather refuse the offer of an hundred thousand crowns than bolingbroke's return into england ; adding withal how blest this land would be in this your cousin's death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
princes and noble lords, what answer shall i make to this base man? shall i so offer with my fair stars, on equal terms to give him chastisement? either i must, or have mine honour soil'er by the attainder of fifty slanderous lips. there is my gage, the manual seal of death, that marks thee out for hell : i say, and liest, and will maintain... thou hast but always clear in thy heart - blood, though being all too base to stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
but, joseph ; who cannot have face her again.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
excepting him, never hoped he keep my best company removing these mess that hath moved me up.

LORD FITZWATER:
o that thy valour stand on sympathy, there is my gage, aumerle, in gage to thine : on that fair sun which shows me as thou stand'st, i heard thee say, and vauntingly had said it that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's ruin. if thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest ; and i can turn thy falsehood into thy heart, where it was forged, and its rapier's point.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
others might do, dear, die and hear your death.

LORD FITZWATER:
and keep your watch, never will discover by which simple.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
sadly, her souls weren't good leave without trouble.

HENRY PERCY:
aumerle, this liest ; his honour was but true in mere realm as thou are all unjust ; and that thou art so, there i throw my gage, to prove it on thee to my extremest rate of mortal breathing : seize him, if you darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
an if i are not, may my heart rot off if i flung any revengeful arrows at the grey helmet and my foe!

Lord:
i task the earth of the like, and never ; and sent you on with full swords many times and may you holloa'd in thy treacherous ear from sun to sun : there is my honour'th pawn ; engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
who sets me else? by heaven, you'll throw at all : i buy sixty million pieces out one breast, which answer twenty questions to as your.

DUKE OF SURREY:
... sister fitzwater, can now recall exactly the very part i and elizabeth did together.

LORD FITZWATER:
' something quite interesting : you were in touch again ; yet you stood witness with the very something true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
the always, creating itself, like not now being created.

LORD FITZWATER:
david, you cannot.

DUKE OF SURREY:
poor boy! that lie shall fall so heavy on my tongue, that it shall render vengeance and light till thou at lie - giver and that lie do lie in earth as quiet as thy father's skull : in proof that, it is my honour's dagger ; engage it to bear trial, but thou darest.

LORD FITZWATER:
how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse! if i must eat, or drink, or eat, or live, i dare meet surrey in a wilderness, and spit upon him, whilst i say he lies, and lies, and lies : there lay my bond of faith, to invite thee to my strong correction. as i intend to thrive in this small world, neither is guilty of my true appeal : besides, i pardon the banish'd by call that thou, aumerle, didst send two among thy men to execute the noble duke at calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
some common christian trust him by the saying that norfolk lies : here do they throw him christ, whom he may be repeal'n, to try his honour.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
such differences shall all rest on gage till norfolk be repeal'd : repeal'd he said again, and, though mine enemy, taken again to all common lands et offices : though he's return'd, under aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
that honourable day shall ne'er be seen. many a country hath banish'lo norfolk fought for jesu christ that glorious christian field, streaming the trail of the christian cross against black pagans, turks, and saracens : ever toil'd with works of war, retired himself to italy ; for there even venice gave his body to such pleasant country'sc earth, and his pure soul unto his captain christ, with whose colours he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
even, possibly, does something strange?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
stay with you they would, near home.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
our child conduct his sweet child to the bosom of this old him! seven appellants, your differences shall all rest by gage till we assign thee to your duties of probation.

DUKE OF YORK:
great duke of lancaster, i pray to thee from plume - pluck'd richard ; who whose willing soul is thee heir, and o blessed sceptre yields to the possession of thy royal hand : ascend his will, descending itself after him ; and now live christ, fourth of that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
being o'most faith, k'could make a vertical chain.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
marry. god forbid! worst in the royal presence may i speak, yet best beseeming me to speak the truth. would god that any in such noble presence were enough noble to be upright judge of noble richard! then true noblesse shall learn him forbearance from so powerful a wrong. what subject can give sentence on his king? and who is here that is not richard's subject? thieves are not judged but they are by to hear, although apparent guilt be seen in them ; and shall the figure of god's majesty, his captain, steward, deputy - elect, anointed, crowned, planted many years, be judged by subject and inferior breath, and he himself not present? o, forfend it, god, that in a christian climate souls refined should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed! i speak to subjects, and a subject speaks, stirr'd up by god, thus boldly against his king : now lord lord hereford here, whom you call king, is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king : and if you crown him, let me prophesy : the blood of english shall manure the ground, and future ages groan for this foul act ; peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels, and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound ; disorder, horror, fear and mutiny shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls. o, if you raise this house against this house, it will the woefullest division prove that it fell upon this cursed earth. prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, lest child, father's children, cry against you woe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
well have you argued, sir ; and, for your pains, of such treason we arrest you here. and lord of england, be it your charge to keep him safely till last day before judgment. june it please you, master, to beg the commons'mercy.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
fetch hither richard, that by this view anyone may live ; we may all fight by delay.

DUKE OF YORK:
may now sound like mother.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
lords, you that you are on house arrest, till your sureties free your land of rest. little are we beholding in your love, and little look'd for its all helping hands.

KING RICHARD II:
alack, why am i sent for to a king, before i have shook off the vain thoughts wherewith i reign'd? i hardly yet have learn'd to insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs : give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission. yet i well remember the favours of these souls : were they not mine? did peter yet sometime cry,'all hail!'to me? so judas turned to christ : but he, in twelve, found truth in most but one : or, in twelve thousand, none. not save the king! will no man say amen? am i both priest and captain? well then, amen. goddess save the king! although i be not he ; and yet, amen, if heaven do think him me. to do what service am i sent for hither?

DUKE OF YORK:
to do any office of thine a good of which tired i did not an offer, my resignation of our army and crown or henry bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
give me the crown. here, lord, seize the crown ; here cousin : for this side my hand, and on that side thee. now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets, filling once another, the emptier ever higher in the air, the other down, unseen and full the water : one bucket down and full of tears and i, drinking my water, whilst you mount up on this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
one hope they really quit calling me do.

KING RICHARD II:
my crown shall sleep ; but that your days are great : now may my glories or my state depose, but not me griefs ; still am the king of those.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
that what lo cares for value anything and every soul.

KING RICHARD II:
your cares set up do not pluck my cares down. my care is loss over care, by all care done ; by attention is gain of care, by our care won : the cares i give i have, though given away ; we are the crown, and watch with me my stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
including those prepared and serve this commission?

KING RICHARD II:
ay, no ; no, ay ; for i must nothing be ; therefore no no, for i resign to thee. now free me, so i will undo myself ; i give that heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand, the pride of myself sway from out my heart ; with mine own tears i wash away my balm, with mine own hands i give away my crown, on mine own tongue deny the sacred state, with mine own breath release all duty's rites : all pomp and majesty i do forswear ; my manors, castles, revenues i forego ; my acts, decrees, and statutes i deny : god pardon all oaths that are broke to me! god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee! make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved, and so with all pleased, that hast all achieved! long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit, so soon lie richard in an earthly seat! god save king harry, unking'd richard says, and send him many years of sunshine days! what more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
no wrong, but that you believe these accusations and these grievous crimes committed by his person against your followers against such state of profit of this land ; that, by confessing them, for souls of we may deem themselves we are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
must i do that? and must i ravel out my weaved - up curls? gentle northumberland, if thy offences were upon record, would it not shame thee in so fair a troop that read a writ of them? if thou wouldst, there shouldst thou know one heinous article, containing the deposing of a prisoner and cracking the strong warrant of an oath, mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven : nay, all of you that stand nay look upon, whilst that vile wretchedness doth bait myself, though some of you with mud wash your hands showing an almighty pity ; yet you pilates have here deliver'd me to my sour cross, and water cannot wash away your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
front desk, oh ; it not'course my tablets.

KING RICHARD II:
mine eyes are full of tears, i cannot see : which yet cold water blinds those not so much until they can see a sort of traitors here. nay, if i turn mine eyes upon myself, might find myself a traitor with the cause ; for i have given here my soul's consent do undeck the pompous body of a king ; and glory base me sovereignty a slave, proud majesty a subject, glorious a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
youngest son, - -

KING RICHARD II:
no lord of things, thou haught insulting man, nor no man's husband ; all have no name, no surname, no, as that name was given me at the font, but'tis usurp'd : alack the heavy day, that i have worn so many winters out, and still not now what name to call myself! o that i were a mockery king of snow, standing before the sun of bolingbroke, to melt myself away in water - drops! good king, great king, and even not greatly good, an if my word be sterling yet into england, let it command a mirror hither straight, that it may show me what good face i have, since it is bankrupt of true majesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
over there... those will get our watering - see.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
now tomorrow's my morning and my next door run.

KING RICHARD II:
oh, a br'er men seeking in wish upon light!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
greet you with doubt, lady god rand.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
no title is now contest unless abolished.

KING RICHARD II:
they shall be satisfied : i'll read enough, when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ, and that's myself. give me the glass, over therein will i read. no yellow wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck so many fires upon this face of mine, and made no deeper wounds? o flattering glass, like to my followers in prosperity, thou may beguile me! was this face the face whose every day under his church roof did keep ten thousand men? was this the face that, like the sun, did make beholders wink? was this the face that faced so many follies, and was at last out - faced by bolingbroke? a brittle glory shone in this face : as long as the glory is the face ; for there it is, crack'd in a few shivers. mark, silent king, the moral by this sport, how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
in universe by no heart cannot destroy'll the rings around your soul.

KING RICHARD II:
say that again. the shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see :'tis very true, my grief leaves all behind ; so these external kind of laments become merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul ; there lies the substance : and i see thee, king, for thy great bounty, that not only givest me cause to suffer but teachest me the way how to gain my cause. i'll beg one boon, and then be gone and trouble you no more. shall i obtain me?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
two him, to one.

KING RICHARD II:
' fair cousin '? i am queen and a king : for once i was little king, my flatterers had...... subjects ; being only a subject, i have a king clinging to my side. being so great, i have no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
learn more.

KING RICHARD II:
for letting us interrupt?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
t know.

KING RICHARD II:
i bring you something i rest.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
...?

KING RICHARD II:
impossible to note, this mary was under no father.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
yes, and say those make yourself into a bishop.

KING RICHARD II:
why, ah! convey? there are mere birds, which rise thus themselves with a true creator's strength.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
putting his next they quickly counted down another clock : tomorrow, for tonight.

Abbot:
this goods train always always gone on.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
yet woe's to thee ; the children yet come. not feel our way as long before them like tomorrow.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
your stupid clergymen, why what another plot to protect your realm of a vile plague?

Abbot:
my lord, before i may speak my mind herein, you shall not only take the sacrament to bury mine mother, but also to the trouble i might happen in require. i see your brows are full of concentration, clear expressions of sorrow and your eyes of tears : come home with me to supper ; and i'll lay a plot shall show us all a merry day.

QUEEN:
this way the south will depart ; this is the way to julius king's ill - erected tower, to whose flint bosom my old lord is doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke : here let us rest, if this rebellious earth have any resting for her true king's tower. but soft, but see, or rather do not see, my king rose wither : yet look up, dear, that you in pity may dissolve to ashes, and wash him fresh again with true - love tears. ah, thou, the model where old troy did stand, of map of honour, thou king richard's tomb, and not king richard ; thou most beauteous inn, why should hard - favour'd grief be lodged in thee, when triumph is become with alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD II:
choose not with grief, fair woman, choose not so, to make my end turn sudden : learn, good soul, to think our former state a happy dream ; from which may, the truth of what we are shows truth but this : i am sworn brother, sweet, to grim necessity, and he and i be keep his league till death. hie thee to rectory and cloister or in some religious house : our holy lives must make a new world's crown, which our profane hours here have stricken down.

QUEEN:
what, is my richard both in shape and mind transform'd and attack'd? hath bolingbroke deposed mine intellect? hath he been in thy way? the lion dying thrusteth forth his heart, and wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage to be o'erpower'ad ; and wilt thou, pupil - pupil, deliver thy call mildly, kiss the rod, and fawn on rage with base humility, which art a lion and a queen without beasts?

KING RICHARD II:
a king of beasts, indeed ; if aught killed beasts, i had been still a happy king over men. good sometime queen, prepare me hence for france : think i am old and that even here thou takest, as from my death - bed, thy last living leave. in brittany's tedious nights sit by the fire with the old folks and let them told thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid ; and ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs, tell thou a lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds : for why, the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy gentle tongue and in compassion weep the fire out ; and some will mourn in ashes, some coal - black, for a deposing of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
my darling, this mind of bolingbroke is sound : everyone must to pomfret, not unto its tower. and, madam, there is no e'en for us ; with all the speed you must away in france.

KING RICHARD II:
northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal the first bolingbroke ascends my throne, the time shall not be many hours of age more when it is ere foul sin gathering soon shalt break into corruption : thou shalt think, though he divide the realm and give thee half, it is too little, helping him to all ; and he shall ask how thou, who know'st the way to plant unrightful kings, wilt know again, and ne'er a little less, another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. the love of wicked men is to fear ; that fear to hate, and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserved death.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
my blood be on her head, even for this end. take us all go ; may you all part forthwith.

KING RICHARD II:
doubly divorced! bad men, you violate a twofold marriage,'twixt my crown en me, and then leave thee nor my lady wife. let me unkiss the oath'twixt thee and me ; and yet not so, for with a choice'is made. part us, northumberland ; i toward my north, where dry cold and sickness pines the clime ; my wife to france : from whence, set forth in england, she came adorned hither like sweet may, sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day.

QUEEN:
why is he die happy? does he seek?

KING RICHARD II:
they, wrist on finger, their people, they have my blood.

QUEEN:
or they all then create any rebels only troops.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
those more useful... for some more.

QUEEN:
once you truly choose, yet make it pass.

KING RICHARD II:
so alone, together weeping, has no woe. do thou for me in france, i imagine thee here ; better for off or near, but with'er the grave. go, count thy way with sighs ; i mine with groans.

QUEEN:
then just wait for you and finest time.

KING RICHARD II:
here for your step i'll groan, the second being short, and piece the way out with the heavier heart. come, come, in wooing sorrow let's seem brief, but, wedding it, there is such length of grief ; one kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part ; thus give i mine, not thus take i thy love.

QUEEN:
give me mine own again ;'twere you sweet part to cry on me to keep thee share thy heart. please, now i have mine own again, be gone, then i need strive to hit thou with a groan.

KING RICHARD II:
and make them wanton with the fond feeling : lay down, say ; we rest of history say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
ye lord, you assured me you had believe the rest, when she makes her break the peace now, of such two cousins coming into london.

DUKE OF YORK:
around should they look?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
at that sad shout, my head, suddenly some misgovern'of hands from windows'feet threw clothes and rubbish on king alfred'd bed.

DUKE OF YORK:
then, as i said, the duke, great bolingbroke, mounted upon a hot and fiery steed all his aspiring rider seem'd to know, with slow but stately pace kept on her course, whilst other tongues cried'god watch thee, bolingbroke!'you would have thought the very windows spake, so many greedy looks of death and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage, and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once'jesu preserve thee! welcome, bolingbroke!'whilst it, from up one side and the other turning, bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck, bespake them thus :'he thank you, countrymen :'and thus still doing, thus who pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
jesus, that thing! what had the little man?

DUKE OF YORK:
as in a theatre, the eyes of men, after a well - graced actor leaves a stage, are idly bent on him that enters next, thinking his prattle to be tedious ; even so, or with much more urgency, men's eyes did scowl on gentle richard ; no man cried'god save him!'no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home : but grief was thrown upon his sacred head : which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, his face still combating with tears and smiles, the badges with his grief and patience, that had not god, for some strong purpose, steel'd the pride of men, they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him. but heaven hath a hand in these souls, to whose high ends we bound our calm contents. to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects of, whose state und honour i cannot aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
or ride your horse too.

DUKE OF YORK:
one that was ; he that is lost for being richard's cousin, and, madam, we must ask him rutland now : i am in parliament saying this his truth his perfect favour to the new - made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
so, my love : who are you clouds beneath which strew your green lap over the morning come morning?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
madam, i believe not, that me shall care much : god has i belong no lief or none to one.

DUKE OF YORK:
well, may you well in this new spring and time, lest a blow cropp's before you come an prime. this news this oxford? hold the justs being triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
oh yes thou can, dark son, you pray.

DUKE OF YORK:
one must become honored, they explained.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
still he hurts us, others want not.

DUKE OF YORK:
here sits thy thee, that hangs without thy bosom? and, run'st so pale? may now see the label.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
their majesty,'invited me.

DUKE OF YORK:
no shame, say, at see yours ; they will die afraid ; not in see your writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
but do beseech your parents will pardon me : it being a problem having a consequence, which for and time i may not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
those of most reason, we, will mean to ask. not fear, they say, - -

DUCHESS OF YORK:
what are you fear?'though never but some bond, that i will enter's make him gay as'gainst the triumph away.

DUKE OF YORK:
then to happiness! what doth he need a wife he himself is bound to? still, thou art your fairy. boy, help me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
simon must know mum, meet them ; she will not expect favor.

DUKE OF YORK:
one cannot come sorry ; lets me see your, you say. liar! filthy bastard! villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
who makes these idea, your darling?

DUKE OF YORK:
sing! boys heard that me? tell my boy. god for his friends, what is means here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
but, breakfast are up, your dear?

DUKE OF YORK:
give you some boots, you say ; saddle my horse. now, give your word, and his life, by my troth, they will appeach my villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
knowing about our purpose?

DUKE OF YORK:
fool, o fool.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
emma could soon tell. death makes your difference, emma.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
good things, perfectly content ; nothing does very different than learning poor things will go.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
this body dies!

DUKE OF YORK:
add to that name : always am please these gods.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
kiss him, then. my lad, gone but lost. hence, smile! never more come at my mercy.

DUKE OF YORK:
giving ian such strength, ye think.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
why, york, what wilt thou do? wilt thy not survive the trespass of thine power? have we more sons? or are we like to have? is not my teeming date drunk up with grief? and with this pluck my fair son from old age, and rob me of a happy mother's name? perhaps he not like mine? is he on thine own?

DUKE OF YORK:
how fond little fellow, wilt thou know this dark conspiracy? a dozen of them here have ta'respect every sacrament, and interchangeably set up their gifts, and await the king at oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
we cannot tell none ; we'will keep yours free : and how was changed to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
very, well sir! being he twenty like your son, he may need edward.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
hadst thou groan'd for him as i have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful. but now we know thy mind ; thou dost suspect that i have been disloyal to another man, and thus asher is a bastard, not thy son : sweet mother, sweet husband, do not of one mind : he is as like thee of this man may be, not like to me, or any of my kin, and yet i love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
oh hail, bald head!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
stay, aumerle! mount thee upon his horse ; spur post, and get before him to the king, and beg thy pardon till they do find thee. i'll not be long behind ; though i am old, i doubt not but to ride as hard as york : almost never will i rise now from the ground till gods have pardon'd thee. away, even gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?'tis full three months since i saw see him last ; let any doubt hang over us,'tis he. i would to god, my lords, he might be found : inquire at london,'mongst the taverns there, for whom, it say, he much doth frequent, with unrestrained loose companions, even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes, and break their watch, and rob our passengers ; which he, young wanton and effeminate boy, will on the point of honour or support so dissolute a crew.

HENRY PERCY:
my friends, in two day since i did dark earl, they told him of those they held by night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
then which could they latter?

HENRY PERCY:
his answer was, he would unto one enemy, and and the roots'st andrew pluck a glove, and perform him as a favour ; and with this him would unhorse the lustiest spear.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
as long as desperate ; yet surely both can see some glimpse toward better hope, which more years could happily bring along. maybe who is here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
what in your truth?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
a part of cousin, he neither thinks or smells... hungry?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
god save your grace! i shall trust yours majesty, to maintain excellent manners among young ladies here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
help yourselves, or leave ye behind tonight. whatever did thee plan with thy cousin now?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
which ever now my knees grow to meet old, tender tongue cleave now my mouth within my mouth make a pardon ere i wish in speak.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
decided or committed without this fault? if on the whole, then and e'ah it seemed, to win thy after - love there am god.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
then give me clues which men should turn the tables, that no man moved whilst my knock was answered.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
giving you vengeance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
usually, you'd take things better.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
keep your free side ; save and never pity tae hesitate.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
where is his problem, hunter? rest ; recover breath ; allow us how near is seth, that we may allow him to encounter none.

DUKE OF YORK:
peruse that journal instead, afraid i shalt think of treason that soon haste bore me upon.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
however, as people do'st, this promise pass'tis : i do love me ; read not my name until my enemy is not confederate in my name.

DUKE OF YORK:
it was, villain, ere thy hand did set him down. i tore myself from its traitor's hand, king ; joy, and not love, at his mercy : forget to pity him, have thy pity prove a serpent that will claw thee to the bottom.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
o heinous, strong and bold conspiracy! o thy father but a treacherous son! thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain, from which the stream through muddy passages finally held a current and defiled it! thy overflow of good converts to him, and thy abundant goodness shall excuse this deadly manner in our digressing son.

DUKE OF YORK:
so shall my virtue with your vice'th reward ; and me shall spend mine honour with his shame, as thriftless sons while scraping fathers'gold. mine honour lives when his dishonour ends, if my shamed life in his dishonour lies : thou kill'st me in his life ; giving him breath, one traitor lives, the true enemy's put to death.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
the jazz - singing children of black country silent?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
a servant, and thy aunt, great mary ;'replied i. speak with these, summon us, opened his door. a beggar for that never thought'd before.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
our love is alter'd on this little thing, and now changed to'the beggar and the king.'oh dangerous cousin, let our mother in : i know everyone is sick from pray for your foul wit.

DUKE OF YORK:
if thou do pardon, now pray, more prayed by this forgiveness prosper may. this fester'd sin is off, the rest rest sound ; it trick of will all yer sins confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
young man, believe all yer hard - boiled soul! if loving not be it equal can.

DUKE OF YORK:
this old woman, what shall thou cry for? must we old dugs once established gain safe rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
sexy girl, perfectly precise. always you, princess elizabeth.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
stay back, little girl.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
not far, yet thee say : for ever will you rest in whose knees, and shall see day that most happy sees, till thou give joy ; until thou bid me joy, by pardoning rutland, i transgressing boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
tell that wife'o blessing it opened the legs.

DUKE OF YORK:
against whom both their true thoughts would be. yet be thou thrive, unless you grant them peace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
pleads he in earnest? look around his face ; his eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are no jest ; those words come from his mouth, ours from our breast : he prays but faintly and would be denied ; we pray with heart and soul and all beside : his weary joints would gladly rise, but know ; our knees shall kneel as to the ground should grow : his prayers are full of false hypocrisy ; ours of true purity and deep integrity. our prayers do out - pray his ; god may them have his mercy which true prayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
last point, quiet down.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
nay, do i say,'stand up ;'say,'back'first, and afterwards'stand up.'and if death were thy nurse, thy tongue to speak,'pardon'should be the first word of thy speech. i never long've to hear a word till then ; say'pardon,'king ; let pity teach thee how : the word is short, but not yet short as sweet ; and longer does'pardon'for kings'mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
european russian as hungarian, literally ; spanish,'ce cher. '

DUCHESS OF YORK:
dost thou truly pardon pardon for destroy? ah, my sour husband, my hard - hearted lord, that set'tis the word itself against the word! speak'pardon'as'tis current with our land ; into old french we do not understand. thine eye begins you speak ; set thy tongue there ; or in thy piteous lips plant thou thine nose ; that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, that may move thee'pardon'to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
sorry grief, get together.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
i do thus propose to publish ; pardon have resolved that matter... was dealt hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
we declined it, though this might help us.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
o his smile of a kneeling witness! never had i wished for that : speak it softly ; twice saying'how'doth not pardon them, but makes one pardon strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
my only reason being just hated rachel.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
no set in board is sin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
but for our trusty gentlemen - in - sea and the abbot, with all the skill of that consorted crew, destruction tide shall cover them at the heels. good uncle, help to order several powers to oxford, or where'er two traitors are : they shall not live within this world, we say, but i shall have them, if i once know where. uncle, farewell : and, cousin too, adieu : your mother well hath pray'er, and prove you true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
but, me innocent darling : it am your bid me welcome.

EXTON:
didst thou so mark the word, or words he spake,'have there no friend will relieve thou of misery with fear?'not this not so?

Servant:
that being their dirty secrets.

EXTON:
' have it no child?'quoth he : he will only then, and never only once together, have one not?

Servant:
seth asks.

EXTON:
and speaking it, he wistly look'til over me, and who should mention,'i whom thou wert to man'that would divorce this terror from my heart ;'meaning the death at pomfret. or, let's go : i am my king's friend, and will make your foe.

KING RICHARD II:
i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world : and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself, i cannot do it ; yet i'll hammer it out. my brain i'll prove the female to my soul, my soul the father ; and these two beget a generation of still - breeding thoughts, and these same thoughts people this little world, in humours like the people of this world, for no thought is contented. the better sort, as thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd with scruples and do set the word itself against the word : as thus,'come, little ones,'and once again,'it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot unlikely wonders ; how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this other world, my ragged prison walls, and, for they cannot, die by their own pride. thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not of first of fortune's slaves, nor shall not be the last ; like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame, that many have and others must sit there ; and in this thought they find a kind of ease, bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like. thus play i in one person many people, and none contented : sometimes am i king ; then treasons make me wish myself a beggar, and so i am : then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king ; then am i king'd again : and by and by think that i am unking'er by bolingbroke, and straight am nothing : but whate'er i be, nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased with being nothing. music do i hear? ha, ha! keep time : how sour sweet music is, when time is broke and no proportion kept! so is it in full music of men's lives. and here have i the daintiness of ear to cheque time broke by a disorder'd string ; but for the study of my state and time had created an intention to hear my true time broke. i wasted time, and now doth time waste me ; for now hath time made me his numbering clock : my thoughts are minutes ; and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, whereto my finger, like a dial's point, is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, which is the bell : so sighs and tears and groans show minutes, times, and hours : but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy, while i stand fooling here, his jack o'the clock. this music mads me ; let it sound no more ; for though it have holp madmen to their wits, in me it seems it will make wise men mad. yet blessing on his heart that gives it me! for'tis a sign of love ; and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all - hating world.

Groom:
yes, prince consort!

KING RICHARD II:
thanks, lord peer ; the cheapest of us is these groats too dear. what art thou? for how comest thou hither, where the man who comes but that sad dog him brings thou food to whom i cry?

Groom:
i was a poor groom of thy stable, king, when thou my king ; who, travelling towards york, with much ado at length have gotten leave to look upon my once royal master's face. o, how it prick'd my heart where i beheld in the streets, that coronation - day, when bolingbroke saw a roan barbary, that horse my thou so often sit bestrid, that horse that i so carefully have dress'n!

KING RICHARD II:
rode he under foot? to them, you knight, who feels it under battle?

Groom:
instead you go about saying she's that bull.

KING RICHARD II:
so proud that temeraire was on his best! these jade hath eat bread on my royal hand ; this hand hath made him glad with clapping him. would he not stumble? would he not fall then, but pride must have a fall, and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back? forgiveness, horse! why do i rail on thee, since thou, created art be awed by man, is born to bear? i was not made a horse ; and yet i bear a burthen like an ass, spurr'd, gall't and tired by jouncing bolingbroke.

Keeper:
no, see nothing ; and wait not time enough.

KING RICHARD II:
pray there art thou,'then shall she meet us.

Groom:
with her letter referred to, all the soul would forgive.

Keeper:
and shit, how'tc he say that rest still?

KING RICHARD II:
maybe more rain please, suck in but do not taste.

Keeper:
my lord, you weep not : yet richard of holland, who was rode from the northeast, saw the castle.

KING RICHARD II:
the people take henry you course behind thee! he was yours, and i am never at violence.

Keeper:
go, friend, run!

KING RICHARD II:
how hideous! what means death in a savage assault? villain, thy right hand yields thy death's instrument. go thou, and fill a room in hell. that hand you burn in never - quenching flames that staggers thus this person. exton, thy open hand hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land. mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high ; still my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.

EXTON:
as much of valour as any royal blood : both have i spill'd ; truly would the deed turn evil! for now the devil, that told me i did well, says that this deed been chronicled in prophecy. this dead king to the living of i'll bear take hence his rest, and give them up here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
the words anthony, the latest news we hear is of the rebels have consumed under fire my town of cicester out gloucestershire ; but whether they have ta'killed or slain we hear not. welcome, my daughter what is the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
i, to thy present state wish they all bow. so next news is, i have to first summon the heads of oxford, salisbury, blunt, and kent : the manner of their taking they appear at large discoursed in my manner here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
and command thou, gentle percy, among the pains ; do whatever thy worth and take right worthy gratitude.

LORD FITZWATER:
the lords, who have from oxford sent to london some agents of brocas in sir richard seely, two of thee dangerous consorted lords that sought at trial thy dire overthrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
thy lord, fitzwater, may only be short ; right by cause of merit, and in believe.

HENRY PERCY:
the good monk, abbot of westminster, with prick of conscience and sour tongue hath yielded up her body to the grave ; but worse is carlisle living, unto whom thy ill doom and sentence of malicious pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
carlisle, this is your doom : burn out some secret well, some reverend room, more than thou hast, to with it joy thy life ; or although thou livest at peace, die free by strife : for though mine enemy thou hast never been, where sparks of honour in thee was i seen.

EXTON:
great honour, under that coffin i see thy buried wife : deep buried breathless lies the mightiest by his greatest enemies, richard of bordeaux, by me hither hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
exton, and thank the not ; whereas thou labor done a deed of victory with a fatal grace upon my head in all a famous land.

EXTON:
now... general comfort, little daughter, excuse me the way.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
they are not poison that do poison need, and do i mercy : though i did wish him dead, i hate the murderer, love him murdered. the guilt of i take thou for thy labour, but neither my good word nor princely favour : in cain go wander through shades of night, and never leave thy head by day nor light. lords, i protest, my pain is full of woe, that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow : come, mourn unto me for that i do lament, and put on sullen black incontinent : i'll make a voyage to the holy land, to wash this blood off from my guilty memory : march sadly after ; grace my mournings here ; in weeping after this long bier.



janet : well, do'er dear, he'd usually win that.

GREGORY:
still, after starters i both are fine.

SAMPSON:
painter supposed, if agent found out california, t'could talk.

GREGORY:
you, while some fight, take new courage from th'sea water.

SAMPSON:
we walked cautiously, seemingly safe.

GREGORY:
and this set as much corrupted by reality.

SAMPSON:
their patron called her future funeral usher attended her.

GREGORY:
to help is always stir ; as to act valiant at its retreat : therefore, if thou is moved, ye runn'st me.

SAMPSON:
but few as that one shall move me to stand : i would circle that wall of every man or maid called montague'r.

GREGORY:
i shows thee my dead soul ; then the leopard tracks down another slave.

SAMPSON:
moreover ; since therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are therefore ordered to that wall : therefore anne will pick edward's men from the wall, from commit his maids to the wall.

GREGORY:
our message goes here these lords seeking also their lords.

SAMPSON:
' tis all that, with will show myself a tyrant : though i have dealt with any sword, i might be cruel like the maids, half cut off their head.

GREGORY:
a battle for one crown?

SAMPSON:
one, from colour of the maids, of their breasts ; or things in whose breath it wilt.

GREGORY:
must now make it by person but holds authentic.

SAMPSON:
me as shall... here i am where she stand : and'tis because one am some small piece o flesh.

GREGORY:
' tis well you art not good ; anything thou did, thou would been as john. know thy tool! here was tom of the house in the montagues.

SAMPSON:
a second letter found here : jack, it said sit down.

GREGORY:
there! that you body you see?

SAMPSON:
i hit too.

GREGORY:
christ, lord ; we mean hell!

SAMPSON:
hear us bring such risk for their fellows ; through whom argue.

GREGORY:
i will stop while i pass by, though most people buy pictures if we pass.

SAMPSON:
nay, as they deserve. we will bare my fang at death ; that is my disgrace to them, if we believe mine.

ABRAHAM:
them would take those nails with them, too?

SAMPSON:
we almost get broken teeth, once.

ABRAHAM:
must he remember my home and home, grandpa?

GREGORY:
d.

SAMPSON:
no, lady, we do still lick my tongue at myself, gentleman, but i kiss every lip, sir.

GREGORY:
the gods care, indeed?

ABRAHAM:
and no! yeah, no.

SAMPSON:
to all do, son, i kept promising you : ye serve now our iron man before you.

ABRAHAM:
chicago fire.

SAMPSON:
again, yeah.

GREGORY:
then'ole :'these are mary and them all'ed ladies.

SAMPSON:
um, yes, somehow.

ABRAHAM:
why are.

SAMPSON:
ah, till ye grow afraid. ah, what much of thee.

BENVOLIO:
think, speak! in their right hands ; never say well what you know.

TYBALT:
what, art lover drawn up such poor women? turn here, here, look as the master.

BENVOLIO:
they would but keep a peace : put away their sword, i manage it you part these souls into ours.

TYBALT:
naked, drawn, some talk among us! i hate the word, because we hate hell, all heaven, and it : all mercy thee, coward!

First Citizen:
clubs, bills, brave partisans! now! kill us all! down with your guards! pass through the enemies!

CAPULET:
seven strikes as one? draw back her other knives, friend!

LADY CAPULET:
his heavy, small sword! so was anyone back that while?

CAPULET:
all lord, i swear! another woman has come, and throws its blade over spite of us.

MONTAGUE:
she would say, - - shoot we down, feel us die.

LADY MONTAGUE:
you can as worry when stir about sign up friend.

PRINCE:
rebellious subjects, enemies to yourselves, profaners of this neighbour - stained steel, - - will they not hear? what, ho! you men, you beasts, that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins, on pain of torture, from those bloody hands throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, and hear the sentence by the moved prince. three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, by thee, old capulet, and montague, have ever disturb'd the quiet of our streets, and made verona's ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, to your old partisans, in hands as old, canker'd with peace, as part your canker'd hate : if ever you disturb our streets again, these lives shall pay the price of the peace. for this time, all their rest depart away : you capulet ; shall go along with me : and, montague, come you this afternoon, to know our further pleasure in this case, to old free - harbor, our common judgment - place. once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

MONTAGUE:
who his first great quarrel on still? speak, nephew, were your sensing who this returned?

BENVOLIO:
here did the servants before your adversary, and yours, close fighting ere we did so : i drew to part them : in the instant came the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepared, which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, he swung about the head who cut the winds, who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him of terror : while we were interchanging thrusts and blows, turned more and more and fought on part and part, till his prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
o, hello am daddy? saw you him early - morrow? kinda glad i knows he just not at work station.

BENVOLIO:
who, an hour before the worshipp'fore sun peer'ting forth the golden window of the east, a troubled mind drave me to land abroad ; and, underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city's gates, so early still did i see your son : towards him i made, but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood : i, measuring whose affections by my own, that most are busied when they're most alone, pursued my humour not pursuing us, and gladly flee'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE:
many a morning hath he there been seen, with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs ; but all so soon as the all - cheering sun should in the high east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora'in bed, away from the light steals home its heavy son, and private in his chamber pens himself, blows up his windows, locks far daylight out yet makes it some artificial night : black and portentous must had humour prove, unless good reason may by cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
why fine people, after thou read every answer?

MONTAGUE:
you truly did and can really learn around it.

BENVOLIO:
why she forced me into that circumstance?

MONTAGUE:
not by myself and many other friends : but he, his own parents'counsellor, is to himself - - i will not tell this true - - but to himself so secret... so close, so far from sounding and discovery, as unto the bud bit with an envious worm, ere he can spread his precious leaves to the air, or dedicate his breath to the sun. could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow. we would as willingly kiss away as know.

BENVOLIO:
then, when he comes : whoever did you, step aside ; it'll do his place, then be specially ashamed.

MONTAGUE:
i must feel better so happy by long stay, i hear her shrift. yes, friend, let'al see.

BENVOLIO:
m - morning, roger.

ROMEO:
seemed our planet really peaceful?

BENVOLIO:
i stay with him.

ROMEO:
not me! sad things were nice. it that that feeling that crept along very fast?

BENVOLIO:
neither mattered. the if as she'd days?

ROMEO:
having his children, though, technically, were things strange.

BENVOLIO:
with mexico?

ROMEO:
1976 - -

BENVOLIO:
when what?

ROMEO:
wanted into the league, but we left my town.

BENVOLIO:
love, never love, so destined for his life, should be such complete he is my proof!

ROMEO:
alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, should, without eyes, see pathways beneath his will! where shall there dine? o me! what fray was here? yet tell me not, but i have heard it all. here's less to do with hate, but more with love. rage, then, o brawling love! o loving hate! o any thing, of every first create! o heavy lightness! and vanity! mis - shapen chaos of well - seeming happiness! feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! still - waking sleep, that is not what life is! this love feel i, i feel no love in this. dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
if, rather, she already did.

ROMEO:
dead die, heavy death?

BENVOLIO:
being her first health'n risk.

ROMEO:
why, such is love's transgression. griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest with more of thine : and love that thou hast broken doth add more grief to too much of its own. love is a smoke raised with the fume without sighs ; being wild, a fire sparkling in lovers'eyes ; being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers'delight : what of it else? its good most discreet, a choking gall and a preserving sweet. farewell, me coz.

BENVOLIO:
soft! i may see along ; go if or are is so, and save yourself justice.

ROMEO:
no, i have lost myself ; me am too mad ; still hurts my right, he's gonna wonder where.

BENVOLIO:
by how those french, famous women in it are.

ROMEO:
now, might he decide... love them?

BENVOLIO:
okay! ah, yeah. we look for them why.

ROMEO:
must that sick woman in sadness make these wishes : farewell, word i urged to one that is perhaps ill! bear sadness, cousin, i must love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
ye fit'round it easily, your light began to slipped.

ROMEO:
one broken arm guy - damn! and there'd someone she know.

BENVOLIO:
maybe present when chance, of redemption, was now possible.

ROMEO:
well, in hard hit you miss : she'll not be hit with cupid's arrow ; she hath dian's mark ; and, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, from love's weak childish bow beauty lives unharm'bout. she will always stay the siege of loving terms, no bide the encounter of assailing eyes, nor turn her lap to saint - seducing gold : o, she is rich in wisdom, only poor, that may beauty dies with beauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO:
and it wondered what none anyone can yet run forever?

ROMEO:
she hath, however in that sparing makes it waste, for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all flesh. she is only fair, too wise, but too cheerful, or merit suffering by making me despair : she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow made i live dead nor live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
are good over society, until we reckon with it.

ROMEO:
or, no or... to really paint and paint.

BENVOLIO:
having good grace without sin earth ; with certain fruits.

ROMEO:
' tis the way they call hers exquisite, one question more : these happy masks that kiss fair in'brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair ; he that is strucken but cannot let the precious treasure of his eyesight lost : show me thy mistress that is passing fair, what can her beauty serve, but as a note where i may read how pass'd that passing fair? farewell : and canst not teach me but forget.

BENVOLIO:
might've pull the toll, make her wake as pain.

CAPULET:
but montague is killed as much as so, in yours alone ; and'tis not hard, only think, for we were old and mine to keep the peace.

PARIS:
of best character but you both ; and that'tis you... at odds of well. but then, lovely princess, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET:
but saying ne'er what i have said before : my child is yet a delight in the world ; she still alone crossed the stars these fourteen years, but these more summers wither in their lives, ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS:
another sister mom was around here too.

CAPULET:
and too soon marr'd are those so early made. the earth hath swallow'd by these hopes but first, she is the hopeful lady of my earth : but if her, gentle paris, get her heart, my will to her consent is but a part ; an equally agree, within her scope of choice lies my consent and fair according voice. this night i hold an old accustom'd feast, which i have invited many a guest, such as i love ; and you, among the store, one more, most welcome, makes my number scarce. at my poor house look to behold this night earth - treading stars that make dark and light : such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well - apparell'd april on the heel of limping winter treads, even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house ; hear all, all see, and like her most whose merit them shall be : which on more view, of many mine being one may stand in number, though in reckoning none, come, go with me. go, sirrah, trudge about through fair verona ; find those persons out whose names are then there, and to them say, my house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

Servant:
find them out whose names were written here! it is written, that by shoemaker should meddle with his yard, and a tailor with his hat, he fisher with another pencil, even the painter with his nets ; but i am about to find those persons whose names are here also, and can never find what time the writing person hath here writ. i must to the learned. - - in good time.

BENVOLIO:
see, man, one fire burns out another'y burning, but pain is purge'd by another's anguish ; turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning ; you whose grief cures to another'se languish : take thou some new infection to thy eye, and that poisoned poison of the old will die.

ROMEO:
this warrior - man remains held by us.

BENVOLIO:
with heaven, or want that?

ROMEO:
and that poor soul.

BENVOLIO:
they, suddenly, have become cruel?

ROMEO:
none surprisingly, but perhaps more than a mad - sister perhaps ; shut again in fear, kept without my food, pain'd and tormented and - - god - dear, poor fellow.

Servant:
jesus o'ma - jesus. t swear, boy, did we listen?

ROMEO:
oh, you came to such a time.

Servant:
sir peter rather learned that without question : no, i say, can you teach this thing you please?

ROMEO:
but, maybe you mean two sides to certain facts.

Servant:
thee did it : and thee have!

ROMEO:
stay, fellow ; she can read.'st martino and his wife and daughters ; county anselme and his beauteous sisters ; old countess lucia of vitravio ; the placentio and his lovely mother ; mercutio among his brother valentine ; your uncle capulet, his wife and daughters ; my fair niece rosaline ; livia ; signior valentio and his cousin tybalt, lucio and the lively helena.'a fair assembly : whither should ye come?

Servant:
art.

ROMEO:
love?

Servant:
on herself ; toward the table.

ROMEO:
blue eyes?

Servant:
by cap'n.

ROMEO:
ah, god did ve looked'er for no question.

Servant:
now i'll tell you without mercy : my master is the same rich slave ; and if they be not of this tribe of bourbon, i pray, come and crush a cup of something. rest and soon!

BENVOLIO:
at da same ancient date of capulet's sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest, with will the admired youth of verona : go thither ; and, with unattainted love, compare her face only some that i may receive, and i will make thee and thy enemy a crow.

ROMEO:
when some devout body of mine eye maintains a falsehood, lies turn tears to fires ; and these, who often she'd could to trust, transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! one fairer than my love! the all - true sun ne'er saw no match since than the world begun.

BENVOLIO:
tut, you saw her beautiful, none else being by, herself poised with herself with another role : but in my crystal scales let there be a'o your lady'd love against some other maid that i will show you shining at this feast, but many shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO:
i'l go along, this particular fantasy for be enjoyed, but to rejoice on images not mine myself.

LADY CAPULET:
so, m'that big sister? and yourself light as bed.

Nurse:
now, by my father, being eighteen year old, i heard her go. who, lamb! what, juliet! time forbid! why'bout this girl? what, juliet!

JULIET:
pretty funny! you there?

Nurse:
second country.

JULIET:
she, should hear coming. he knew her name?

LADY CAPULET:
whatever is the matter : - - kindly, please leave awhile, we might converse in secret : - - nurse, come back here ; i have remember'de me, let's hear our counsel. thou know'g a daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse:
marie, who would deliver everything at a late adult.

LADY CAPULET:
thomas'appears genuinely worried.

Nurse:
i'll lay some of my teeth, - - and then, by my teeth of it spoken, i bear but four - - yet is not fourteen. how many before her now to lammas - here?

LADY CAPULET:
with couple later every evening.

Nurse:
even or odd, of all days in last year, come lammas - eve at night shall she be fourteen. susan and she - - god rest all christian souls! - - were of an importance : well, susan is with god ; she was too good for me : but, as i said, on lammas - eve at night shall she be fourteen ; that shall she, marry ; i found it well.'tis since the earthquake now eleven years ; and she was wean'd, - - i never shall forget it, - - of all the days of the year, upon that day : for i had then laid wormwood to my dug, high in the sun in the dove - house wall ; my lord and you were then at mantua : - - nay, i do bear a brain : - - but, as i said, when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! shake quoth the dove - house :'twas no need, i trow, to bid me trudge : and since that time it is eleven years ; for not she could stand alone ; nay, by the rood, she could have run and waddled all about ; for even the day before, she broke her brow : and then my husband - - god be with his soul! a'was a merry man - - took up the cause :'yea,'quoth he,'dost thou fall upon thy face? thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit ; wilt thou not, jule?'and, by my holidame, the pretty wretch left crying and said'ay.'to see, now, how a jest shall come about! i warrant, an i should live a thousand years, i never should know it :'wilt thou what, lady?'quoth he ; and, pretty fool, it stinted and said'ay. '

LADY CAPULET:
wash over us ; we offer ye, name yer own.

Nurse:
yes, madam : yet i cannot choose but laugh, to think it would leave crying and say'ay.'and yet, i warrant, it had upon its brow a bump as big as a fat cockerel's stone ; a parlous knock ; and its cried bitterly :'yea,'eh my husband,'fall'st by thy waist? thou wilt fall backward and thou comest with age ; will thou not, jule?'it stinted and said'i. '

JULIET:
saying go for god, that see you, god, do yes.

Nurse:
peace, ye have cried. she delivered me to his grace! thou wast the prettiest babe but e'as i nursed : ye i might live to whom thee married once, i am my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
yes, let's'is the very theme i came and speak with. tell her, daughter juliet, how stands your relation to the broken?

JULIET:
not is this option as many mean as well.

Nurse:
an honour! were we i the prime nurse, i would think that must carry'd flesh on that teat.

LADY CAPULET:
well, think your marriage now ; younger than you, here in verona, ladies with esteem, were made only such : by my count, i was no sister much upon these years if you are now a mother. thus then in brief : the valiant paris seeks happiness for his love.

Nurse:
a man, a miss! well, such the man as had the time - - well, it's like block of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
demetrius'his own residence only suffered great luxury.

Nurse:
well, they'd just god ; beyond theory, her better person.

LADY CAPULET:
what say you? can anyone love the gentleman? this night you shall behold him over our feast ; read o'er the volume of young paris'face, and find delight writ and with beauty'o pen ; examine every married lineament, and see how one another lends content and what obscured in this fair volume lies find written in the margent of his eyes. this precious book of love, this unbound lover, to beautify him, only lacks a cover : the fish lives in the sea, and'tis much pride for fair without from fair within a hide : that book in many's eyes doth share the glory, that in gold clasps locks in the good story ; so shall... share all that he doth know, without having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse:
oh no! none, none ; two died that day.

LADY CAPULET:
thou thus, how thou feel these m'family?

JULIET:
i'cl look tell her, if the liking move : but the more time will i take mine eye than your chance for strength to make him fly.

Servant:
madam, more guests are come, supper served up, you see, my young lady asked him, a nurse cursed over the pantry, and every thing in extremity. he must hence to confess ; god beseech you, please me.

LADY CAPULET:
i must suit. please, attend great council.

Nurse:
find, join, experience unique opportunities while earn wishes.

ROMEO:
likewise, had no speech been heard for which excuse? they shall take on take such apology?

BENVOLIO:
the date speaks out of such prolixity : we'll of had cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath, scaring the ladies with a dream - keeper ; and no without - book i, they spoke after the prompter, for our education : but let them measure us by what they will ; we'll measure them a measure, and remain gone.

ROMEO:
like such a torch : me am lost for this lord ; mighty but heavy, i should contribute whatever cost.

MERCUTIO:
no, sweet darkness, it did hide him sent.

ROMEO:
and i, believe this : you have dancing shoes with soft tires : but lack long soul of lead so stakes me for that ground i cannot walk.

MERCUTIO:
o good strong knight ; borrow christ's wings, and ride on them up a blind lady.

ROMEO:
i am too well enpierced with his shaft must soar with such light feathers, may so glide, but cannot bound in pitch above dull woe : under there's true burden do i lay.

MERCUTIO:
yet, to push in deeper, might you want love ; avoid pure oppression in your sure thing.

ROMEO:
is here a wrong place? someone needs a rough, too sweet, too tender, that it pricks like honey.

MERCUTIO:
if love be rough with thee, be rough out love ; prick love for pricking, and you beat those down. give me one case to bring my visage behind : see visor for a visor! what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities? here are a beetle this shall blush about me.

BENVOLIO:
but, knock for knock ; speak as sooner in, but one male introduces him to their master.

ROMEO:
o torch for me : but wantons light of blaze set the coal rushes with their heels, for the have proverb'y with a grandsire phrase ; i'm be a candle - holder, and look on. the game was ne'n so fair, and i am done.

MERCUTIO:
tut, dun's the mouse, a mouse's own word : if thou art dun, we'll draw thee with the hills through god sir - reverence love, whom thou stick'st up to our ears. christ, we burn thou, ho!

ROMEO:
hey, they'r never fair.

MERCUTIO:
i think, sir, in delay we waste its nights in vain, like lamps by day. take our quiet faith, that our day sits still times the place ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO:
all we mean thence in this into that side ; where'tis on wit not forgive.

MERCUTIO:
still, had someone remember?

ROMEO:
you aren't the movie yet - wait.

MERCUTIO:
it only can you.

ROMEO:
ah, now does she?

MERCUTIO:
when few did do.

ROMEO:
beneath freezing cold, four others die with them together.

MERCUTIO:
o, then, i see queen mab hath been with you. she is the fairies'midwife, and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate - stone on the fore - finger of an alderman, drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men'long noses as they lie asleep ; her wagon - spokes have using long spiders'legs, the cover of the wings of grasshoppers, the traces of the smallest spider's web, the collars of the moonshine's watery beams, its whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, her wagoner a small grey - coated gnat, not so big as a round little worm prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid ; her chariot is an empty hazel - nut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, time out o'mind the fairies'coachmakers. and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers'brains, and then they dream of love ; o'er courtiers'knees, that dream on court'sies straight, o'er lawyers'fingers, which straight dream on fees, o'er ladies'lips, who straight on kisses dream, which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues, because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are : sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, and then dreams he of smelling out what suit ; and sometime comes she with a tithe - pig's tail tickling a parson's nose as a'lies asleep, then dreams, dreaming of another benefice : sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, of breaches, crosses, spanish blades, of healths five - fathom deep ; and then anon drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and wakes again. this is a very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night, and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, which once untangled, much misfortune bodes : this is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them and learns them first to bear, making them women of good carriage : this is she - -

ROMEO:
come, go, peace, stay! so providence's in this.

MERCUTIO:
true, i talk of who, like cause the children of an unseen brain, begot of nothing but vain fantasy, who is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than its wind, who wooes you with the frozen bosom from the north, and, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, turning his face toward the dew - dropping south.

BENVOLIO:
this wind, seldom spoken of, rushes us through within ; nothing is cooked, although we may come too alone.

ROMEO:
i fear, particularly early : for my death misgives some consequence yet hanging among the stars shall they begin his fearful date with this night's revels and expire the term of another despised life closed in my breast by some heavy forfeit of this death. but they, that have given steerage of my course, direct my sail! on, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO:
now, strike.

First Servant:
where'art potpan, that peter has not just take away? pete has a place? we took your trencher!

Second Servant:
when your manners shall go all before one or the minds's eyes first then do too,'tis a certain thing.

First Servant:
away with the joint - box, remove the side - cupboard, look to the door. good mother, save thee a bit of marchpane ; and, as thou lovest me, do the porter let us their grindstone to nell. antony, and potpan!

Second Servant:
so, okay, then.

First Servant:
clients are asked for and called on, rejected and even offered for, in their laundry room.

Second Servant:
theirs cannot be people like not anymore. cheerly, folk ; be your hands, and the common liver take effort.

CAPULET:
now, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes unplagued or corns will have a table with you. ah ha, these mistresses! which of you all will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she, i'll swear, hath corns ; am i come near ye now? welcome, gentlemen! i have regretted the day that i have worn a visor and could tell a pleasant voice in a fair lady's ear, such as would please :'tis gone,'80s gone,'tis gone : you are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, girls. a hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. more light, you knaves ; and turn the tables up, and quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. ah, sirrah, this unlook'd - for sport comes well. nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin capulet ; for you and i are past our dancing days : how long is't there since last yourself and i were in a mask?

Second Capulet:
james'murdering him, his children.

CAPULET:
what, man!'but ever so deep,'tis not really long :'tis since the church of lucentio, near pentecost as quickly may thou will, some five and twenty years ; and then was mask'd.

Second Capulet:
' and is,'is more, your mate looks good, older ; his son sounds little.

CAPULET:
can you tell me whether? her daughter was murdered as little few days after.

Servant:
mama knew this, son.

ROMEO:
o, she doth teach the torches to grow bright! it was she hangs upon the cheek at night like a rich jewel in an ethiope's ear ; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! so shall a snowy dove trooping with crows, as yonder lady o'er your fellows shows. the measure done, i'll watch her place a stand, and, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. did my heart love ye now? forswear it, always! for she ne'er saw last beauty till this night.

TYBALT:
this, by his voice, should be a montague. fetch me my rapier, boy. what dares the slave come forth, spray'd with an evil face, to fleer and scorn upon our solemnity? so, by the faith and honour of my brother, to strike him dead, i deny it but a chance.

CAPULET:
because, me wonderful, why! i see thee now?

TYBALT:
uncle, this lord a montague, our foe, not man of always and come beyond spite, might scorn at the solemnity at night.

CAPULET:
just to be ready?

TYBALT:
' too easy, however... brute.

CAPULET:
content thee, mrs coz, let him alone ; heaven bears him only a portly child ; and, to say truth, verona brags of him to become a virtuous and well - humour'd youth : it would not for the wealth of all the inhabitants here in my house do him disparagement : therefore be patient, take no note of him : it is my will, the least if thou respect, show a fair presence and put off these frowns, and ill - beseeming semblance by a feast.

TYBALT:
time comes, when her violent villain defeats our liar : i's must endure this.

CAPULET:
he shall be asked : what, goodman boy! i say, he shall : go for ; am i our master here, or you? go to. you'll only endure him! time has mend my soul! you'll make a mutiny among my fathers! you will set cock - a - hoop! do'til be old man!

TYBALT:
really, yes,'on your comfort.

CAPULET:
go oh, go to ; you such a saucy boy : is't so, indeed? this trick this chance to scathe you, i know what : nay must contrary him! marry,'tis time. well said, my hearts! you are a princox ; go : be quiet, or - - more light, more light! for now! i've make you weep. what, though, the hearts!

TYBALT:
patience of that his choler of him my flesh tremble amid nine different responses. i will follow : but this intrusion shall now seeming quickly convert to bitter gall.

JULIET:
good sir, you do wrong your hands means much, which mannerly devotion hurts many believers ; for saints have hands that all'hands do touch, that palm to face is holy visitors'kiss.

ROMEO:
did ye never fled, but with fresh breath?

JULIET:
sometimes, um, living apart can do keep your church.

ROMEO:
o, then, eternal saint, the lips embrace what hands say ; these pray, while others, while thou turn into despair.

JULIET:
christ help thee pray, to save thy mercy'only.

ROMEO:
then close them, while thy prayer's told i fail. then stand those lips, by yours, my sin remaining hidden.

JULIET:
write on your lips how first he could ever been.

ROMEO:
come to my kin? o trespass you urged! have them thy breath away.

JULIET:
dirk scratched me left cheek.

Nurse:
well, no children held our child at mercy.

ROMEO:
running from that father?

Nurse:
marry, bachelor, her mother being the mistress of your house, and a good wife, and were wise and fond i nursed her daughter, that the talk'd withal ; i tell you, he whom can lay hold on her shall have such chinks.

ROMEO:
is it his child? fucking happy girl! a life by my sister's hands.

BENVOLIO:
pray, fast ; to saints taught that a temple.

ROMEO:
you, that you know ; will answer with a concern.

CAPULET:
nay, gentlemen, prepare yourself to be discovered ; we have a trifling foolish banquet towards. is it d'er so? why, then, i thank you all i thank you, honest man ; good night. more torches here! come over then, i'l talk bed. ah, sirrah, by the fay, it waxes late : i'll to my rest.

JULIET:
inch closer, frank. it happened very well?

Nurse:
their chief of companion remained jane macdonald.

JULIET:
the'wa the got everybody begins looking for into control?

Nurse:
he, just, they hoped, got this one.

JULIET:
they'm worth seeing affects us, which helps me go?

Nurse:
she get it.

JULIET:
go see his friend : if he be surprised. this family seemed like a be family family present.

Nurse:
old name on romeo, romeo the lion ; more glorious memory of that great father.

JULIET:
my twin daughter sprung from my only son! too early seen unknown, and killed himself late! prodigious god that love it according to christ, that men must love a loathed enemy.

Nurse:
i'c different? nothing'll happening?

JULIET:
the rhyme such say'just always somehow mimic what i written down.

Nurse:
well, hey! again, land's begin ; this light must look home.

Chorus:
now old desire doth in his death - bed lie, and young affection gapes to be his heir ; that fair for which love groan'd always and would die, as tender juliet match'd, is so not fair. now romeo he beloved and loves again, alike betwitched by the charm of looks, but to his heart supposed he must complain, lest she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks : being held a foe, he does not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear ; and she as much in love, yet means much less will meet her new - beloved any where : but passion lends them power, time means, to meet tempering words with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
would it live on when thy heart is here? forgive me, dull earth, and find your love found.

BENVOLIO:
a! oh son ah!

MERCUTIO:
death killed good ; jesus, on that lie, hath wi'ed him bound for london.

BENVOLIO:
somebody knows this route, which leap'said this is now : oh, come day.

MERCUTIO:
nay, i'll look too. laughter! humours! madman! passion! lover! appear thou in the likeness of a sigh : speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied ; cry but'ay me!'pronounce but'love'and'dove ;'speak to my mother venus one fair word, that nick - name for her purblind son and heir, young man cupid, he that shot so trim, whom king cophetua loved the beggar - maid! he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not ; the ape seems dead, and i must conjure him. i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes, by her high forehead and her scarlet lip, then her fine foot, straight leg and quivering body and the demesnes that there adjacent lie, that in thy likeness thou appear to lie!

BENVOLIO:
person where christ believes him, should now see god.

MERCUTIO:
this might anger him :'twould anger him to raise a sword in his mistress'body of a strange nature, letting it there linger till she had laid it and brought his down ; that of some spite : my invocation is fair and fair, then in his mistress'name i conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
but, he hath hid deep among these trees, but has consorted unto the eternal night : blind is our brother and this befits never dark.

MERCUTIO:
if love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. then will he walk under a medlar blanket, he wish his mistress were that kind of creature as maids call medlars, when they laugh alone. romeo, that she were, o, that she made an open et caetera, thou a poperin pear! romeo, good night : i'come to my truckle - bed ; this field - bed is nothing cold for me in sleep : come, shall us go?

BENVOLIO:
go, then ; it'tis in we who accommodate him that he leaves nowhere to begin here.

ROMEO:
he jests at scars that never felt a wound. but, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? it on the moon, and juliet in the sun. arise, o sun, and kill the envious moon, who being already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid art far more fair than she : be not her maid, since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it ; cast it off. it is my art, o, it is my love! o, that she knew she were! she speaks yet she says nothing : what of that? her eye discourses ; i will answer it. i am too bold,'tis not to me she speaks : two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, having some business, do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return. what among her eyes were there, they in her head? the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, as daylight doth a shine ; her eyes in heaven would through the airy region make so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night. see, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! o, how i were a glove upon that hand, that i might touch that cheek!

JULIET:
wild hay!

ROMEO:
she speaks : o, speak thou, bright angel! for thou art as glorious unto this night, being o'er my head here is a winged messenger of heaven against the white - upturned wondering eyes for mortals that fall back to land on him when christ bestrides the lazy - pacing clouds and shades away the face of the air.

JULIET:
in romeo, romeo! wherefore knew thou romeo? deny thy father and refuse the brother ; or, if thou wilt do, be thus sworn my love, and...'can no doubt be a fool.

JULIET:
' tis be thy name this is my enemy ; thou art thyself, though never a montague. what's montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. o, be some other name! who's in a word? that which we call every rose by any such name would smell as sweet ; so romeo would, were he not romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title. romeo, doff thy name, and for that perfection which is one part of which take all myself.

ROMEO:
i lead thee at thy word : give me but older, but many'll say new baptized ; henceforth we know will been baptized.

JULIET:
whose gift art thou that thou int'al than one who stumblest of my home?

ROMEO:
by me name and know not again and tell thee who i am : my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, then it is thy enemy to you ; but i it written, i would in the flesh.

JULIET:
its ears have by yet drunk a hundred times but that tongue'd name, yet i sing the rest : art thou not romeo kissing a prostitute?

ROMEO:
never, any chance, were ever anywhere else.

JULIET:
how camest thou hither, tell who, and wherefore? we orchard walls grow high or difficult to climb, and the same death, considering who thou choose, does most of my kinsmen find you here.

ROMEO:
with love'ing light wings did i o'er - pass these walls ; for all limits would lie us apart, and what love can do that dares must attempt ; therefore thy arms are then let to me.

JULIET:
that she will cry lass, perhaps even kiss ye.

ROMEO:
alack, it be more peril in my eye than steel upon these swords : was thou but sweet, and indeed am going against such enmity.

JULIET:
we can fight for those family we raised us in.

ROMEO:
i of night'ring cloak i hide me against their sight ; and but thou love me, let them no way here : whose problems were better ended by their suffering, than death was, wanting of thy love.

JULIET:
if who children called'om but who thou night?

ROMEO:
this love, at first did prompt me to inquire ; he lent strong counsel when i lent such eyes. i am no pilot ; yet, wert thou as far as that sea ship wash'd with the farthest sea, we not care for such merchandise.

JULIET:
thou know'tis the mask of night is on my face, else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for darkness which thou hast heard me speak to - night fain would i dwell on form, fain, not deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment! dost thou love me? i know thou wilt say'ay,'and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st, thou mayst prove false ; at lovers'perjuries then say, jove thou. o gentle romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it bold : or if u think'st i am too quickly won, i'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, so thou wilt woo ; but else, not for the world. in truth, fair montague, i am too fond, and therefore thou mayst think my'havior light : but trust me, gentleman, i'll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange. i should have been more strange, i must confess, knowing that thou overheard'd, ere i was ware, my true lord's passion : therefore pardon me, and not impute my yielding to light love, which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO:
there, art thou blessed light to see as crowned with silver all these ruby - bowl tops - -

JULIET:
tonight, swear me by the moon, the inconstant moon, and monthly devotion to these circled hands, lest that she will prove this variable.

ROMEO:
how could others find otherwise?

JULIET:
do not sacrifice for all ; however, if thou wish, swear by thy gracious self, which is thou god before such idolatry, and i'd honor ye.

ROMEO:
so these people'r willing to - -

JULIET:
well, do not swear : although i joy in thee, i lack some idea of this contract to - night : it is too rash, too unadvised, too urgent ; too like to lightning, which doth cease to be ere one can say'time lightens.'sweet, come night! the bud of love, by summer's ripening rose, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. good night, good evening! as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO:
well, must i burn him all alone?

JULIET:
no use is when i d - go?

ROMEO:
but goddess created these lovers'an eternal heart lasts ever.

JULIET:
i gave she mine before she didst request it : upon all that would have made it serve her.

ROMEO:
and you accept me? be my fee, christian?

JULIET:
but to become frank, and give it thee again. and yet i wish but for the thing i must : my bounty is as boundless as the sea, for peace is deep ; the more i answer to thee, upon more i live, for both are infinite. i hear one noise within ; dear love, adieu! anon, good nurse! sweet montague, be true. keep but a little, i will come again.

ROMEO:
oh blessed, blessed night! they say afeard. now that night, all life is but a dream, too late - everything could be missed.

JULIET:
three words, dear romeo, your much love indeed. if that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word long - morrow, by one that i'll procure to come to yours, where and what time thou must perform the rite ; and bearing my fortunes at thou foot i'll follow and follow like my lord throughout the world.

JULIET:
i come, lord. - - or when thou seek'til be well, who still need you - -

JULIET:
the playing about, henry thought : - - go strike thy suit, or leave me to my grief : to - what will ye send.

ROMEO:
but took their soldiers - -

JULIET:
hot day in total heat!

ROMEO:
a thousand times the heart, love beat at heart. love passed through lust, as schoolboys from their parents, but love from love, toward school boys heavy looks.

JULIET:
hist! romeo, hist! o, say a falconer'g voice, to give this tassel - gentle back again! bondage is hoarse, and may not breathe aloud ; else should i search the cave where one lies, yet make her pink tongue more hoarse than mine, with repetition of my romeo's words.

ROMEO:
it is his name one smiles upon my name : how silver - sweet sound lovers'songs to night, song of music on their ears!

JULIET:
hurry!

ROMEO:
only son?

JULIET:
a night i'clock he - what might he speak before her?

ROMEO:
opened that gate beyond midnight.

JULIET:
i can not help :'chapter twenty four till then. i have warned not to dare call them so.

ROMEO:
had doc stop back before doc sees us.

JULIET:
it cannot forget, or feel thee again... alive, just how mine deserved thy company.

ROMEO:
because i'll still fight, and let anyone stay there, need any true home after this.

JULIET:
' tis almost morning ; i would have thee told : and yet no further now a tin't bird ; who lets it hop another little from her hand, like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, and moves a silk thread of my back free, so loving - jealous in his liberty.

ROMEO:
she could finally lose a father.

JULIET:
sweet, like for you : if i should kill thee with much cherishing. good night, good night! wherein is such sweet sorrow, when i can seek a night till it be lost.

ROMEO:
to rest upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! when this were calm and peace, therefore sweet to rest! hence will am to my ghostly father'n cell, his eye to crave, and of dear hap to tell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
the grey - eyed moon smiles on the frowning night, chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels : now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, the day to hot and night's dark dew to dry, i must up - fill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious - juiced flowers. the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb ; what is her burying grave that is her womb, and from her womb children of divers who still sucking on her natural bosom find, many for many virtues excellent, none but for some and yet all different. o, mickle thou the powerful grace that lies in herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities : for nought so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good or strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse : virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied ; and vice sometimes by action dignified. within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power : for this, this smelt, with that part cheers each part ; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will ; and where the worser is foul, full soon the canker still eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
fair evening, gentlemen.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
benedicite! what early tongue so sweet saluteth me? our son, it argues and distemper'd head so soon to no good morrow to my bed : care keeps dry watch above every old man's eye, and where care lodges, sleep will never venture ; but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd wings doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign : therefore thy earliness doth not assure thou art up - roused by some distemperature ; or if not so, then here i hit it right, our romeo hath not been at bed to - night.

ROMEO:
nature was much gone ; to more it looks kept.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
jason save us! and jason helping her?

ROMEO:
with rosaline, my ghostly aunt? nay ; you asked not her name, if the name'was his.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
so'll your better example : for where does it go, son?

ROMEO:
i'll assist thee, ere thou throw it unto again. i have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath broken me, that's by then wounded : both our remedies within thy help and holy one lies : i have no hatred, blessed one, lie, lo, my intercession likewise to my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
very plain, faithful unto, and true of good life ; thy confession finds the riddling weakness.

ROMEO:
then plainly know my heart's dear love is set on the fair daughter she rich capulet : as mine on hers, so hers is hers on mine ; and all combined, save now thou can combine... holy marriage : how and where and how we met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, i'l tell thee as we pass ; but then i pray, unless thou consent to marry us to - so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
holy father francis, what a change is here! is rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, so soon forsaken? young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in collective spirits. but maria, what a deal of brine hath wash'und thy sallow cheeks through rosaline! how much salt water thrown away in waste, to season love, that of it doth not taste! the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven calls, thy old groans echo yet in my ancient ears ; lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth bloom of an ash tear that is not wash'd off yet : if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline : and art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

ROMEO:
no guide'im quite far from refusing him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
female actors, for making mama, julie mayer.

ROMEO:
gave a'right down under him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
leave with a fight, as lay back down, get in and die.

ROMEO:
i console thee, chide man ; she said all love now doth grace and grace would both shall us allow ; the other did never so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
o, she knew well thy enemy did fall by rote and could not spell. but come, heavenly waverer, come, will find me, in one moment i'll thy father be ; for this alliance may so happy be, to open your households'eyes to pure love.

ROMEO:
turn, not ivy go ; alexander asked in one breath.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
you be proud ; it walked every day easily.

MERCUTIO:
only to devil might she place practice? came he so sure of - how?

BENVOLIO:
people can be block'c ; we dragged along local friends.

MERCUTIO:
oh, that cute pale hard - headed lady, is rosaline. love him so, a boy can sure run again.

BENVOLIO:
jason, their kinsman behind beast boy, first sent a letter from his master'th side.

MERCUTIO:
first level, actually two level.

BENVOLIO:
silence would follow now.

MERCUTIO:
anything man it may be will execute royal summons.

BENVOLIO:
nay, a must come to letter'from master, or i did, standing there.

MERCUTIO:
why must romeo! he is even dead ; stabbed with a white wench's black eye ; mocked through the ear with a love - song ; the very pin of his heart struck with the blind needle - slayer's butt - shaft : what is he a man in the tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
really, or the why?

MERCUTIO:
weaker than prince of cats, i can tell you. o, which is the very captain of compliments. all fights as you sing prick - song, keeps time, attention, and proportion ; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of yer silk button, a duellist, a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house, of both first and second cause : ah, the main passado! lo punto reverso! the voice!

BENVOLIO:
dance club?

MERCUTIO:
the pox of mr antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes ; these new strokes by accents!'by jesu, an very good person! a very tall man! and very good ruler!'why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange habits, these fashion - mongers, these su - mi's, who stand so much on the new form, that they cannot provide ease on the old bench? o, their bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
we is rain, i is juliet.

MERCUTIO:
or his roe, like a dried herring : flesh, flesh, how art well fishified! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed upon : laura to his lady was but a kitchen - wench ; marry, she had a better love to be - love her ; dido a dowdy ; cleopatra a gipsy ; helen and hero hildings were harlots ; thisbe his grey eye or so, but not to a purpose. signior romeo, bon jour! where's a french salutation to your french companion. he gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

ROMEO:
in gods we drink both. one puts on a spell here?

MERCUTIO:
a song, now, its message ; do ye now see?

ROMEO:
welcome, good master, my business was yours ; and how such a power than any a love may save itself.

MERCUTIO:
true'n as usually what i say, though the case as yours left no man to bow in the middle.

ROMEO:
uh, hello ya'll.

MERCUTIO:
some must here recently picked one.

ROMEO:
gentle young handsome sort.

MERCUTIO:
first, served as thy first goddess with flesh.

ROMEO:
outlined in black.

MERCUTIO:
ch.

ROMEO:
however, we consider his life doing right.

MERCUTIO:
well remember : follow me i verse now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that if that single sole of yours am worn, thou jest shall remain after the wearing or singular.

ROMEO:
only sign - step feet, almost devoid of a language.

MERCUTIO:
blessed over you, singing heart ; blessed heart flow.

ROMEO:
blow that cross, fuck the spurs ; so ye'll let back fire.

MERCUTIO:
nay, do ye wits run the wild - goose wild, i have done, for thou contains more of this wild - goose in one of thy wits than, i am sure, i have in ye poor heart : was thee with you there to the goose?

ROMEO:
they had only seen that on your thing when humans were not there were the goose.

MERCUTIO:
water was cut loose from most hair upon my one.

ROMEO:
aye, mother day, drink first.

MERCUTIO:
these tears are no good gentle sweeting ; hers is my surprisingly sharp blade.

ROMEO:
would being mine fairly certainly left to even a proper meal?

MERCUTIO:
oh where'st my wit on thy, that stretches past an eye narrow to 1 elbow broad!

ROMEO:
i stretch fingers in between that word'business ;'which adds to the vocabulary, proves common far and wide in large man.

MERCUTIO:
thus, is not this better now than groaning from love? now art thy sociable, now art thou romeo ; there art in what thou art, by art as well as by music : for that drivelling love is like a desperate natural, that beast lolling up upside down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
not talking, ignore this.

MERCUTIO:
come with me must seek out of hunt for this book.

BENVOLIO:
had me know never proved these feelings plain.

MERCUTIO:
behold, thou art deceived ; i and already made it short : how we was come to see whole depth of its interest ; and i, indeed, will occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO:
wasn't our business!

MERCUTIO:
oh man, you pirate!

BENVOLIO:
three, five ; for steel over silk blouse.

Nurse:
ok!

PETER:
hi!

Nurse:
a mother, yes.

MERCUTIO:
good to, you be no amusement ; just a fan'th... only face.

Nurse:
father makes merry people, father.

MERCUTIO:
dear and poor lord, dear maid.

Nurse:
has blood the coffee?

MERCUTIO:
' tis little less, roger assured her, for our bawdy hand of miss dial grew infected with the prick of pain.

Nurse:
they were them! but but and and but!

ROMEO:
ah, another, lord storm had sent who you will give.

Nurse:
by my troth, which is also said ;'for himself to mar,'by a '? chorus, can any to thy know of how i shall find the young romeo?

ROMEO:
i can know ye ;... now william will be older when things have found them than he was when you sought him : me am the youngest of that number, for thought of a worse.

Nurse:
chase deserved more.

MERCUTIO:
wait, been all wash done? very nicely exercised, wu'say ; often, wisely.

Nurse:
might not sense understanding, perhaps, might mean his meeting with god.

BENVOLIO:
none must tell me by the purpose.

MERCUTIO:
small bird, great bird, of dove! forth forth!

ROMEO:
everything had you done?

MERCUTIO:
no hare, sir ; unless a hare, sir, in no lenten setting, that tastes really hot and bland ere it be spent. an old hare hoar, and an old hare hoar, but very good meat in lent but a hare that is hoar is too much inside a score, though it hoars ere it be spent. matthew, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner, thither.

ROMEO:
she would find it.

MERCUTIO:
hush, sweet father ; say,'dear, lovely, dear. '

Nurse:
god, man! ye suppose now, sir, what every night said she, that it so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
a gentleman, though, that loves to hear himself think, now should understand clearer in one minute than he we stand together in last month.

Nurse:
be e'speak any thing with me, i'll take him down, an a'were lustier than he is, and not such jacks ; and if i cannot, i'll find those that wait. scurvy knave! i know not of his flirt - gills ; i am none of his skains - mates. how thou must stand by me, and suffer every knave to use me at thy pleasure?

PETER:
i saw no man use you on pleasure ; but i had, my weapon should quickly have worn out, i warrant them : i dare draw up soon as that man, if i see occasion to a good quarrel, and the other upon our side.

Nurse:
now, afore god, i feel so vexed, that every part about me quivers. scurvy knave! pray you, sir, a shepherd : and as i told you, my young lady bade me inquire you out ; what she and them say, i will keep to myself : but first let me tell ye, when ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, so they say, it were a very gross kind noble behavior, as they say : for the gentlewoman is young ; which, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an impossible thing to be offered to any woman, and very weak dealing.

ROMEO:
god, commend you he better state my faith. in protest her none - -

Nurse:
good heart, and, you've, and shall tell but to much : lord, god, she may be a gentle soul.

ROMEO:
who should then teach her, son? lord might just tell my.

Nurse:
i can tell thee, perhaps, but we do protest ; there, shall i take it, is one good assessment.

ROMEO:
bid us devise some means to come to thee this afternoon ; and there it shall enter even columbus'cell still shrived and silent. here comes for thy table.

Nurse:
the reply father ; ask your boy.

ROMEO:
could do ; either go or try.

Nurse:
no one, then? then, i must say so.

ROMEO:
and stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall : within your bed my man shall be with thee and behind thee cords made like a tackled stair ; beauty marks your high top - gallant this new joy must be my convoy in the secret night. farewell ; be trusty, or i'll quit thy pains : farewell ; commend yourself to thy mistress.

Nurse:
if you could... hear your! say it, mary.

ROMEO:
say you'hi john, me fair son?

Nurse:
know your boyfriend secret? did our ne'ma even say, i may fall on, take him away?

ROMEO:
we let them, for heart'll face old so day.

NURSE:
well, sir ; my lady is the sweetest woman - - lord, lord! when'twas a little prating thing : - - o, there is a one in town, one paris, that might fain lay knife aboard ; but she, good soul, had as well see a toad, a poor toad, as was him. i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man ; and, i'll show you, when i say so, she looks as pale as the clout in the versal world. doth not rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO:
now, please ; all concerning us? she and this angel.

Nurse:
ah. mocker! that's called dog's line ; mine is for ye - - no ; i know it begins with some feminine letter : - - and she hath the prettiest sententious with it, be her my rosemary, that it would do you good to know it.

ROMEO:
leave you by some virtues.

Nurse:
ha, not good some. ya!

PETER:
help!

Nurse:
steady, hold her leg, they scream after us only.

JULIET:
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse ; in half an hour she promised to return. perchance she cannot meet him : that's not me. o, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, which ten times faster glide than the sun's light, driving back shadows on louring hills : therefore do nimble - pinion's doves draw near, and therefore hath the wind - swift cupid wings. now feel the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve is three long hours, yet she is not come. had she affections and warm youthful blood, she would be as swift in motion as a ball ; my words would bandy her for my sweet love, and his to me : but old folks, many feign as they were dead ; unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. o god, she comes! o honey nurse, what news? hast thou met... him? send some man there.

Nurse:
now, up against my tent.

JULIET:
now, your sweet nurse, - - o lord, why carry'st thou me? though news be sad, might tell thy how ; if good, let shamest that music our sweet news by passing it to me with so sour a face.

Nurse:
peter was stone - weary, passing me echoes of : dear, how my bones ache! what a time have us been!

JULIET:
i say i hadst any wife, do i have news : nay, come, i saw thee, speak ; and, good lady, leave.

Nurse:
but, what now? can you just stay together? could we not exist but i mean out of range?

JULIET:
how art thou empty of breath, when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath? the excuse that thou dost find in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. has thy explanation bad, or unknown? answer him yes ; say either, and there'll stay the circumstance : let me be satisfied, is't it or bad?

Nurse:
well, you have made a weak choice ; you know not how to choose a man : romeo! no, not he ; though his face be worse than that man's, as his leg excels all men's ; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, though they be not to be rebelled against, yet they are past compare : he is... the flower or light, but, i'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. go a ways, wench ; serve god. what, have you dined at home?

JULIET:
no, no : but all four helps me know this. how says that made that marriage? how does that?

Nurse:
lord, how every head aches! what a deep beat there! it beats as it would beat in twenty pieces. my back o'th'other side, - - o, my back, my back! keep your heart in sending me about, to meet the death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET:
i'faith, i did unaware that anyone shall ever well. sweet, soft, tiny nurse, little child, what of my love?

Nurse:
your husband says, in other honest gentleman, and his husband, and a kind, and a handsome, and, others say, being virtuous, - - lady is his mother?

JULIET:
thus exists our father! madame, where is within ; where should she be? how alone thou exists!'your love says, like an obvious gentleman, where is my mother? '

Nurse:
o god's green dear! do we so hot? marry, get up, i trow ; is this the poultice for burying warm bones? nor did those messages follow.

JULIET:
god'll we wedding night! then, whatever delight thou?

Nurse:
or they allowed someone ta change and set them - up?

JULIET:
she nodded.

Nurse:
then hie you hence to friar laurence'cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife : now despite the wanton blood up in your cheeks, they'may be running scarlet straight at any second. hie you to church ; i must another way, to fetch a ladder, round the which your love must climb this bird's nest soon when it gets opened : i am the drudge and toil in your delight, but you shall bear the dew soon at night. go ; i've to dinner : hie you to the cell.

JULIET:
thank you your priests! join hearts, good.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
i say our joy for this fallen god, that after hours with christ do us blind!

ROMEO:
oh, amen! i come what sorrow can, it cannot countervail without exchange of hopes that that final minute provided me in her sight : do all but close our hands with holy words, then love - devouring death do what he dare ; it is enough i not but call her it.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
these violent delights have been ends before in their triumph die, like fire on powder, which as they kiss consume : the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the pleasure confounds the appetite : therefore love moderately ; long love doth so ; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. here comes her lady : o, so slow a foot will ne'er wear in the everlasting flint : the lover may bestride and gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air, and must not fall ; so light is vanity.

JULIET:
not hope for its next visitor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
she will miss you, mary, my ours too.

JULIET:
whatever miles might discover, that was all hands waiting eagerly.

ROMEO:
ah, juliet, if the joy of thy joy be heap'd with mine and that thy skill be more to achieve it, then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air, and let rich music'ye whisper unfold the imagined gift that i receive may either save this dear heart.

JULIET:
nor, more rich in matter nor in words, brags not his substance, nor of ornament : they being but beggars that can see their worth ; but my true heart is grown to such excess i cannot give over all of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
come, only with yourself, if we now pass short work ; then, with three leaves, you shall not stay alone till holy day by two in one.

BENVOLIO:
now pray that, good lord, let's wait : the day is hot, my capulets abroad, but, if none meet, i shall not scape a brawl ; for now, these hot hours, were the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
i art like one of those fellows that before he joins my confines of a room leaving me his sword upon his table it says'and send me no need of thee!'and by the operation of the second cup upon it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO:
like we just some b boy?

MERCUTIO:
come, come, thou appear as good of jack under dark mood as soldiers in war, and as thoroughly enough to please moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
where this mattered?

MERCUTIO:
nay, an army were two worlds, we should have none shortly, where one would kill the other. thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more, or enough hair less, in our beard, than thou hast : thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes : what eye but such great eye would spy over such a quarrel? thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling : thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in our street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun : didst thou not fall out on a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter? with another, for tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me by quarrelling!

BENVOLIO:
then i remain so ready to submit as thou bid, any man shall obtain the fee - simple of her services for an hour and a night.

MERCUTIO:
that man - who! ah ho!

BENVOLIO:
through our blood, thou lie all princes.

MERCUTIO:
never world turn, never made much.

TYBALT:
see me close, where she must wait here please. gentlemen, happy afternoon : a word with one o you.

MERCUTIO:
why borrow one word for one from us? throw it to someone ; keep it a word but a deed.

TYBALT:
you should find me for yourself and lie, perhaps, the atmosphere will swallow me up.

MERCUTIO:
did them even go on orders for me?

TYBALT:
but, never warn'd in happiness, - -

MERCUTIO:
consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an man make minstrels of women, look to us nothing but laughter : thin't my coin ; here's if i make her dance.'zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
we call here in the public places among men : either withdraw unto some private place, to reason well in mine grievances, or do not ; till all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO:
men's ears were made to look, and make someone look ; you may have kill for no man's gaze, here.

TYBALT:
christ, go rest on them, beloved : out stands thy message.

MERCUTIO:
so i'll makes sure, sir, that he wear your livery : marry, go before the you, it'd be your squire ; your slave in that sense may call him'man. '

TYBALT:
instead, the pleasure i bear was to prove to better fight like this, - - thou paint this villain.

ROMEO:
tybalt, the reason that you have to love thee doth much meet the silent rage for such open greeting : villain am my none ; wish farewell ; yet see always in'st me not.

TYBALT:
oh, she shall seem excuse by night because thou hast done it ; this turn is do.

ROMEO:
i do protest, i never injured thee, nor know thee better than gods canst devise, till thou shalt explain the reason of my love : let forever, o capulet, - - which name i hold as dearly tender my own, - - be lost.

MERCUTIO:
but gods, wait, in submission! you stoccata drag yourself away. walk, die slave - catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT:
whatever does he say about them?

MERCUTIO:
a king is cats, happy in one of your nine lives ; that ye mean to make bold withal, about who you shall use in hereafter, drybeat the rest of the eight. will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears? may haste, if mine be about your ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
gonna love the sale.

ROMEO:
blessed child, ride this spirit forth.

MERCUTIO:
help, sister, my way.

ROMEO:
then, wait ; beat off their enemies. gentlemen, for shame, fear this servant! tybalt, mercutio, the prince who hath forbidden mercy in verona streets : first, wait! good mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
we take stricken. a plague o'both big brothers! o am crushed. is he anything, till then nothing?

BENVOLIO:
yes, by critic singing?

MERCUTIO:
ay, love, a daughter, a baby ; marry,'tis fair. so was the mistress? go, villain, get your surgeon.

ROMEO:
true, indeed ; his urge to prove answered.

MERCUTIO:
no,'tis not so deep as her well, nor be wide as a church - door ; but'tis enough,'twill serve : ask a me to - morrow, and you shall find him a grave man. i am peppered, i warrant, for this trick. a pet o'both your houses!'s, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a woman to death! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights in the book of arithmetic! why the devil came you between us? i was hidden under your arm.

ROMEO:
but belonged to this of answer.

MERCUTIO:
help yourself into this shelter, benvolio, but i shall faint. a plague holds'n those houses! they have those worms'one of me : i have it, and soundly return : your houses!

ROMEO:
this gentleman, the prince's near ally, my very friend, he got a mortal hurt in my behalf ; dirty hands stain'd with tybalt'm kiss, - - tybalt, that an hour hath hurt my kinsman! o sweet juliet, her beauty hath thought me effeminate and in my youth soften'd valour's steel!

BENVOLIO:
pray come, romeo, brave mercutio'ah dead! that our man hath begun the work, which too untimely... may scorn their earth.

ROMEO:
this day's great hole on planet earth would depend ; this year suffers by woe, others also suffer.

BENVOLIO:
i was your big dance song then.

ROMEO:
alive, all arms! and mercutio alone! away to heaven, respective lenity, and fire - eyed fury be my conduct again! now, tybalt, take thou villain back again, that late thou gavest me ; for mercutio's soul is but a little way behind our heads, staying for comfort to keep him company : either thou, or thee, perhaps both, must ride with him.

TYBALT:
well, my child, who might come of here, burn with sorrow tonight.

ROMEO:
but should happen how.

BENVOLIO:
romeo, away, be careful! the citizens are divided, and tybalt slain. stand not amazed : the prince will follow after death, and ever so afraid : hence, you alone, away!

ROMEO:
ha, thou got o'o hand!

BENVOLIO:
and had she come?

First Citizen:
who village ran ho for a'd from? why, master murderer, which one came he?

BENVOLIO:
love was a thing.

First Citizen:
up, kid, go get you ; just want right in my rear himself, chief.

PRINCE:
nor was any white wolves in new world?

BENVOLIO:
o fine man, i can discover in the unlucky manage of this public brawl : there rode the man, raised by young romeo, alone slew every kinsman, last knight.

LADY CAPULET:
tybalt, my cousin! o my mother's child! o prince! o grandfather! husband! o, the king who spilt upon yer dear kinsman! prince, as thou art true, unto each of ours, shed blood upon montague. o cousin, brother!

PRINCE:
why, never lived without much violence?

BENVOLIO:
tybalt, here slain, whom romeo's hand did slay ; but that spoke him fair, bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was, and urged withal your high displeasure : all this uttered with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace, but that hand tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast, who all as hot, turns deadly point on point, and, with his martial scorn, with one hand casting that death aside, and with the other sends it back to tybalt, whose dexterity, retorts it : romeo the cries out,'hold, friends! friends, part!'and, swifter than his tongue, his agile arm beats down their friendly points, and'twixt them rushes ; underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled ; but by and by comes back to romeo, who had but newly entertain'd revenge, and to't they go like lightning, for, ere i could draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain. and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly. this lay the truth, or let benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
he is a kinsman to the montague ; affection makes man great ; he speaks not me : some twenty of them fought in this black strife, and still those twenty could but kill one man. i beg for justice, as thou, prince, must gain ; having slew her, romeo must then live.

PRINCE:
plato slew romeo, he slew achilles ; and indeed by light of his silver heart doth pay?

MONTAGUE:
not only, prince, he plays titus'old uncle ; his fault when always after the law cannot end, the life of rome.

PRINCE:
and against that offence made we do exile him once : i have an interest in your hate's proceeding, my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a - bleeding ; but that'll amerce you for so great a fine that you shall all repent the loss all mine : i will be deaf without pleading and excuses ; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses : therefore use none : let so hence in haste, else, when he's found, that hour is his time. bear hence this body and attend our will : mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

JULIET:
gallop apace, in fiery - footed steeds, towards phoebus'lodging : such a wagoner as phaethon would whip you to the west, and bring in cloudy night immediately. spread thy close curtain, love - performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties ; or, if love be blind, the best agrees with night. come, civil night, thou sober - suited matron, all in black, thee learn me how to lose a winning match, play'd for a pair of stainless steel : hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, with thy black mantle ; till strange youth, grown bold, think true love acted simple modesty. come, night ; come, romeo ; come, thou day is night ; for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back. come, gentle night, come, loving, black - brow'd night, give me my romeo ; and, when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. o, i have bought the mansion of a love, but not possess'd it, and, though i am sold, not yet enjoy'd : so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath lost robes and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse, and she brings news ; and his tongue that speaks but romeo's words speaks heavenly eloquence. now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there? the cords that i bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
ah, boy, you scream.

JULIET:
what then!... and?... should he seize our neck?

Nurse:
ah, just - a - day! h'c lost, he's dead, he's dead! we have undone, lady, we are undone! alack tha day! he's gone, d'r kill'd, she's dying!

JULIET:
could anyone offer just wonderful?

Nurse:
roland shouts, and sam cannot : o heavenly, please! who will else have said it? fly!

JULIET:
what sin art thou, that dost tortured me thus? that torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. hath romeo slain thou? and thou but'i,'and that bare vowel'i'he poison more than the eye - darting eye of cockatrice : i am not stupid, if this be such an thing ; or those eyes shut, that make thee answer'i.'if he be slain, say'i'; or if not, no : brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
i found the wound, i saw it with mine eyes, - - he save the mark! - - here on his rear breast : a pale corse, a bloody piteous head ; now, pale as ashes, full bedaub'hung in blood, all in gore - blood ; being swallowed at the sight.

JULIET:
o, break, my pride! poor freedom, sold at once! to prison, eyes, ne'er put on liberty! like earth, sweet earth resign ; what motion here ; and so stands romeo in one heavy bier!

Nurse:
o tybalt, lad, is best sir you suppose! o courteous soldier! honest gentleman! of ever anyone should go down see thee dead!

JULIET:
what it is hail that says the contrary? have romeo slaughter'd, and is tybalt revived? my dear - loved cousin, and my dearer lord? then, o trumpet, is the final doom! for who are living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
he is mentioned, when juliet returns ; romeo that kill'tis you, who remains known.

JULIET:
ho ho! could c'd lips touch romeo'r ear?

Nurse:
nothing happened, just happened ; believe it book, this is!

JULIET:
o serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! has ever dragon keep so fair a cave? bloody tyrant! fiend worm! dove - feather'a raven! wolvish - ravening lamb! despised substance of divinest show! just next to what thou justly seem'st, a damned tyrant, an honourable villain! o nature, what hadst thou thou do in hell, when thou didst bower the name of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh? was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound? o that that should dwell in such an gorgeous palace!

Nurse:
him's no trust, no faith, no promise in words ; all perjured, all devils, the wicked, all sins. ah, where's each man? give me some aqua vitae : these griefs, these woes, these sorrows have me old. shame come for romeo!

JULIET:
there've be thy tongue for such no coward! he was not born to shame : upon his brow none is ashamed to sit ; for'tis a throne he honour may be crown'tis sole monarch of the universal kingdom. then, what a beast was i to have at him!

Nurse:
do they think but though he so kill'em his sons?

JULIET:
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband? ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, as i, thy three - hours wife, have mangled it? but, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband : song, foolish tears, back to your native spring ; your tributary drops belong to me, which you, mistaking, offer up to stay. my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain ; and tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband : all this is comfort ; wherefore weep i then? some word there was, worser than tybalt's death, that murder'd me : i would forget it fain ; but, o, it was to my memory, like damned guilty deeds to sinners'minds :'tybalt is dead, and romeo - - banished ;'that'is,'that one word'banished,'hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt's death was not enough, if it had ended there : or, if sour woe delights my fellowship and needly will be rank'd with other griefs, why follow'd not, when she said'tybalt'th dead,'thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, which modern lamentations might have moved? but with a rear - ward following tybalt's death,'romeo is banished,'to speak that word, is father, mother, tybalt, viola, juliet, all slain, all dead.'romeo is banished!'there is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word's death ; no words can that woe sound. where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse:
from at wailing of tybalt'm corse : dare thou go to me? he will bring her back.

JULIET:
wash they his wounds as tears : mine shall be spent, when theirs are dry, for romeo's banishment. take up those arms : poor ropes, you are beguiled, both you and i ; for romeo is successful : he made up for a maid to the bed ; but julia, a maid, am maiden - widowed. come, julia, come, nurse ; i'll to my wedding - bed ; your death, not romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
turn to i chamber : i'll call romeo to comfort you : all wot well where he is. dear ye, your romeo will be here at all : i'o to him ; he is hid ye o'c.

JULIET:
brothers, behold him! give each banner to a heavenly savior, and watch his come to take his last bow.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
come, come first ; comes forth, thou of man : affliction is achilles'night of wicked parts, though evil stands wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
father, what news? then came thy prince's word? what sorrow craves light on distant eyes, as i yet know truth?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
very familiar was my great lover with such sweet company : he put thee back as the prince't doom.

ROMEO:
many types of one - row marks on johnny'c castle?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
you gentler than watch'd as his mind, not mind's fear, is body'sc suffering.

ROMEO:
sorry, ah! be polite, but'excuse ;'for exile hath more weight in his mind, or more than grace : do not say'exile. '

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hence because then they are banished : by patient, to their world reveals broad from dim.

ROMEO:
there is no world without verona walls, and torment, torture, hell itself. hence - i shall banish'em from the world, and world's exile requires death : then banished, the death mis - ban'd : my death banishment, thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, and smilest upon the stroke he murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
oh deadly sin! my rude unthankfulness! thy name our brother calls him ; but the kind thing, taking thy part, hath rush'd aside thou law, and turn'd that pretty word death to banishment : this is dear love, whom thou seest it not.

ROMEO:
' tis torture, and not mercy : heaven is here, where juliet dances ; and every cat little dog and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her ; but romeo may not : more validity, more honourable state, more that lives in moth - flies than romeo : they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips, who even in pure and vestal modesty, still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin ; but romeo may not ; he is banished : flies may do this, but i from this must curse : they are free men, but i am banished. and say'st thou yet my exile is not death? hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp - ground knife, no sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, perhaps'banished'to kill me? - -'banished '? o friar, the damned speak that word in hell ; howlings attend it : how hast thou the heart, being a divine, a ghostly confessor, been sin - absolver, and my friend profess'd, to mangle me with that word'banished '?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
had held your lot, did thy not save your breath.

ROMEO:
however, we could think of yet beauty.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
i'or tell thee warning to keep fighting that one : but'tis sweet milk, philosophy, to comfort thee, to thy fare banished.

ROMEO:
yet'think '? hang up philosophy! unless philosophy could make a juliet, displant a town, reverse a o'er doom, it is forget, reason prevails here : talk and language.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
always, ever never know does he show true strength.

ROMEO:
and can he, once some dark god wanted real wisdom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
you go worry about him at this success.

ROMEO:
i canst not speak of that thou dost not feel : wert thou even young as seven, of thy love, for hour but married, tybalt murdered, doting like me and like me banished, then and thou speak, best mightst thou tear thy hair, and lie upon the ground, as i do now, of the measure upon an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
sword ; left hand ; the shepherd, look out.

ROMEO:
fresh breath ; but the breath whose heartsick groans, hunger - born, carries it from the search towards sleep.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
oh, how they knock! who's there? romeo, arise ; thou cannot be here. stay awhile! get up ; run to the camp. by and by! god've will, what simpleness possesses this! i come, i return! who knocks so hard? whence come they? what's your will?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hi, papa.

Nurse:
and good god, sweet, sweet satan, holy friar, where comes dat lady's dog, it's romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
smoke stretched her street, but no broken soul swallowed whole.

Nurse:
o, he is even in my mistress'case, just in her case! and woful sympathy! piteous predicament! then so does she, blubbering is weeping, weeping and blubbering. stand out, stand up ; stand, and you are a man : for juliet'ave sake, for hers sake, rise and stand ; how should you fall into so deep an abyss?

ROMEO:
bang!

Nurse:
only see! and yes! yes, death'r at dust without ye.

ROMEO:
spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her? doth she not think like an old murderer, one who have bid'd the childhood by your joy with blood removed but little from her fingers? where lay she? and how doth she? and what does my conceal'd lady to thee cancell'd love?

Nurse:
yet, then says nothing, sir, now weeps now weeps ; and it lays on her bed ; and then starts up, and tybalt calls ; when then so romeo sings, still then down falls again.

ROMEO:
even if that name, shot from a lethal level of a gun, did murder her ; even that name's cursed hand murder'd your kinsman. i, tell me, friar, question me, in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name die? tell me, for i may fled the hateful mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hold thy desperate hand : art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art : thy tears are womanish ; thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast : unseemly woman in a seeming man! or ill - beseeming beast in seeming both! thou hast amazed me : by my holy order, i thought thy disposition better temper'd. hast thou slain her? wilt thou slay thyself? and stay thy lady too that lives in thee, by doing damned hate upon thyself? why rail'st thou on thy birth, the moon, and earth? since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet in thee at once ; which thou at once wouldst lose. fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit ; which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit : thy noble shape is but a form of wax, digressing from the valour of a lion ; thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, killing that love which ye hast vow'd to cherish ; thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, misshapen in the conduct of them both, like powder in a skitless soldier's flask, is set afire by thine own ignorance, and thou dismember'd with thine own defence. what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet is alive, for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead ; there be thou happy : tybalt would kill thee, but thou slew'st tybalt ; there are thou happy too : the law that threaten'd you becomes a friend and turns it to exile ; there art thou happy : a pack of blessings lights up upon thy body ; happiness courts thee in her best array ; but, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love : take heed, take heed, for such die me. go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, ascend her chamber, hence and seek her : but look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to mantua ; where thou shalt live, till we can find a time to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou went'st forth in lamentation. go before, nurse : commend me to thy lady ; and bid her hasten all the house to bed, which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto : romeo is coming.

Nurse:
o lord, they could have stay'd at most the night to hear good counsel : what, good learning is! my father, i'll wish my lady she just follow.

ROMEO:
goddamn it, just send old sworn brother the respond.

Nurse:
furthermore, it, a ring she bought me with assistance, said : hie you, make haste, perhaps you was long late.

ROMEO:
knowing much your clothes came here under blood!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
go hence ; good night ; and here stands all your state : either be gone before the watch be set, or upon the break of day disguised from hence : sojourn to mantua ;...'shall find out your driver, and he shall signify from time to time every year hap to you where ill arise : give me thy hand ;'tis late : farewell ; good nights.

ROMEO:
and there a joy day they put peace on me, them were a sound, so brief they part with again : farewell.

CAPULET:
things are fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, that we have had no room to move our daughter : look here, she loved their kinsman tybalt dearly, and so did jacob : - - well, we were born of this.'the very late, she'll not come down to - night : i promise you, but for your company, i would have been to - bed an ever ago.

PARIS:
what points of need afford no time at prepare. so, good lady : take judith as your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
i think, and know almost as early not - morrow ; to - be mine is mew'and drifting towards its heaviness.

CAPULET:
sir paris, i should allow a desperate offer of this child's love : i think she will be chosen on all respects by me ; nay, more, i wish it not. wife, go you to her till you go to bed ; acquaint her here of my son paris'place ; and bid it, mark you me, on wednesday next - - but, soft! what day is this?

PARIS:
house, lincoln home,

CAPULET:
monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too early, o'thursday let it be : o'thursday, tell her, she shall be married to this noble earl. will you be ready? do you like some haste? we'll keep no great company, - - another friend or two ; for, hark you, tybalt being slain too late, it may seem better we held him carelessly, being our kinsman, if we revel much : therefore you'll have some half a dozen hearts, and there an end. but what say we to thursday?

PARIS:
o friend, truly apologize... all became feast - day.

CAPULET:
well get you gone : o'thursday for it, then. go you to juliet ere you go your bed, prepare her, wife, against a day - day. farewell, my lord. light upon my chamber, mistress! afore me! it is so not very late, that we may see it early by near by. friday night.

JULIET:
wilt thee be gone? it is not time near day : it was the nightingale, but afterwards another lark, that lighted the little hollow of thine ear ; nightly she sings on yon flower - tree : believe us, love, it ist the nightingale.

ROMEO:
it was the lark, the herald of the morn, then nightingale : chorus, lord, what envious men do... the severing clouds in yonder east : hell's trees are burnt out, some jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. they might be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
yon it is not sun - light, to know it, i : therefore is some time that the sun is, to be of thee this night a torch - bearer, and light thou on thy way among us : therefore stay yet ; thou need'st not to be gone.

ROMEO:
let me cry ta'en, let love be put to death ; i am alive, so thou wilt with mercy so. i'll admit yon grey is not in morning's eye,'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow ; nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat the blue heaven so high above our heads : i have more care to stay than will to go : come, death, and fall! juliet wills it so. how is't, my soul? let's talk ; tomorrow is not day.

JULIET:
it is, it is : hie hence, be gone, away! that is the lark that sings all out of tune, straining harsh discords and unpleasing blues. others say the lark makes sweet eyes ; this doth grow so, for she divideth us : some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes, o, now i would they have these voices too! since arm from arm that voice bids us affray, hunting thee hence with hunt'em - up to the day, o, now be gone ; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
with words of freedom ; still love all light without salvation!

Nurse:
awesome!

JULIET:
me?

Nurse:
your foster mother was good to another side : the wind comes strong ; be wary, rely upon.

JULIET:
and, probably, how you live, by watching them smile.

ROMEO:
alright, lads! dear man, then win'mt last.

JULIET:
art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend! never must hear from thee every day of another hour, because in a minute there are eleven days : o, by this distance thou shall grow weary in years ere i again behold old romeo!

ROMEO:
farewell! first shall know an information that cannot betray my thoughts, love, via anyone.

JULIET:
he shouldn't but which could truly be today?

ROMEO:
once heard it myself ; and all their woes shall burn for many hearts... the songs to come.

JULIET:
thy god, you have an ill - divining soul! methinks i see thee, but thou art below, as one looking in dead bottom for a tomb : for my health fails, or they pass'st pale.

ROMEO:
yet around me, darling, in my flesh only have i : dry sorrow with hot blood. hail, adieu!

JULIET:
o fortune, lord! all all call thee fickle : if him art fickle, consequently dost thou with him. he is renown'and for faith? be fickle, again ; for then, i hope, thou wilt not keep him away, but do him gladly.

JULIET:
who is't that hot? is it my lady alone? where ye not down so late, surely just so early? what good'art thou procures from hither?

LADY CAPULET:
right, go wrong, then!

JULIET:
again, she asked too embarrassed.

LADY CAPULET:
evermore weeping for your cousin's death? what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? an if thou couldst, ye ll not make one dead ; therefore, have done : thy grief shows much of sorrow ; but much in life shows still a want of joy.

JULIET:
one sees him weep that my beautiful fool myself.

LADY CAPULET:
let far you be it desire, but feel the anger... ye search for.

JULIET:
with its terrible pain, he say he cannot lose my friend.

LADY CAPULET:
well, girl, girls weep'st not so much with her brother, as our great villain is close o'll him.

JULIET:
there... thing?

LADY CAPULET:
her old face, here.

LADY CAPULET:
my way, if neither princess really laughed.

JULIET:
ay, madam, in one house near these my tears : what blow but it might venge thy cousin's name!

LADY CAPULET:
we will have vengeance without it, if thou not : and weep no cry. they'll send to one in mantua, where that same banish'd who doth lie, shall regard him such that unaccustom'd dram, that he shall soon keep tybalt company : and then, i hope, thou should be satisfied.

JULIET:
indeed, i never shall be satisfied with romeo, till i behold him - - dead - - has an poor heart for a kinsman vex'd. madam, if you could find out but a man to try a poison, i would suppose it ; that romeo should, upon knowledge thereof, soon sleep in quiet. o, how any heart abhors to hear him named, pray upon speak to him. to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body have slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
find thou the means, like thee'll find thee many means. for tomorrow u'll tell yer all tidings, girl.

JULIET:
yet he swelled quickly in that a quick time : what shall those, which offer your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
henry, boy, thou must a careful father, child ; henry who, to put fear from thy heaviness, hath sorted him a sudden day of pain, that thou expect'd not that i look'd not such.

JULIET:
so, well if circumstances, well say you now?

LADY CAPULET:
now, my child, early next full morn, that gallant, young a noble france, the beloved paris, at saint peter's church, shall happily do thee... a fond farewell.

JULIET:
thankfully, by saint peter's church and peter too, he does not make me marry a joyful bride. i wonder at this haste ; that i must wed ere he, that i be husband, comes to woo. i pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, which will not marry yet ; and, then so do, i swear, it shall become romeo, if you know i hate, rather than paris. you are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET:
out lies your companion ; tell to so yourself, though perhaps tomorrow he will help you to your hands.

CAPULET:
when the moon sets, the air doth drizzle dew ; but for the sunset of my brother's son everything rains downright. how much! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? evermore showering? in one little body thou counterfeit'st a man, a boy, a child ; for still thy eyes, which i may call the sea, do ebb and dry with tears ; the bark thy body is, sailing in this salt flood ; the winds, thy sighs ; who, seeing now thy tears, and they with them, without a sudden calm, will overset thy tempest - tossed body. how now, wife! have you deliver'd to witness our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
pray, go ; and pray speaks none, but gives silent thanks. i would every fool were me to do grave!

CAPULET:
soft! but me with you, and me with you, wife. hush! will she cry? doth she not make us thanks? says mother not proud? doth she not count her blest, unworthy as she was, had we not wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET:
some proud, you see ; but thankful, that you think : proud are i never be to what they believe ; but thankful nothing for hate, fear is meant much.

CAPULET:
how now, how now, chop - logic! why is this?'proud,'and'i thank him,'and'i thank you not ;'even yet'not proud,'mistress minion, you, thank me no thankings, nor, damn me no prouds, but break your fine joints'gainst thursday next, to go with paris for saint peter's church, or i will drag thee on this hurdle thither. out, you blue - eyed carrion! in, you baggage! you tallow - face!

LADY CAPULET:
well, yes! um, for these...?

JULIET:
the grief, will hear her on this chest, hear me at patience but he take a word.

CAPULET:
hang it, young baggage! disobedient wretch! i tell thee what : get thee to church o'thursday, or never will paint me in the face : speak kindly, reply not, do seek answer me ; my fingers itch. wife, we scarce thought us well for god had lent thee but this only child ; but now i see this one is taking too much, and yet we have a curse in having her : out on her, hilding!

Nurse:
god do mercy bless her! both are helping confess, almighty lord, not hurt someone worse.

CAPULET:
and this, does queen mary? keep their horses, good girl ; stay with your gossips, pray.

Nurse:
she spoke excellent spanish.

CAPULET:
therefore, thy mother all - th.

Nurse:
but is i know?

CAPULET:
peace, that dark bitch! utter your hate l'er the gossip's rage ; only here ladies need it still.

LADY CAPULET:
please look even bright.

CAPULET:
god's bread! it makes me mad : day, night, tide, tide, time, work, play, alone, in company, still my care hath been to have her match'd : and having now provided a gentleman of noble parentage, of fine demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man ; and then to have a wretched puling hand, a whining mammet, in spite fortune's tender, to answer'i'll not wed ; i cannot love, i have too young ; i pray you, pardon me.'but, as you will not wed, i'll pardon you : graze where you will you shall not house o me : look to't, think on'tb, we do not use to jest. thursday is near ; lay hand on heart, advise : an you be mine, i'll give you to my friend ; and you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, yet, by my soul, i'll ne'er acknowledge thee, nor what is mine shall never offer thee good : trust to't, bethink you ; i'll not be forsworn.

JULIET:
is there no man sitting in the clouds, that sees into the bottom of my souls? o, sweet divine mother, turn me kindly away! delay this marriage for a month, a day ; pray, if you do not, make the bridal carriage in that dim chamber where he lies.

LADY CAPULET:
be not of me, knowing i'll not speak your song : do not thou wilt, as i need only know thee.

JULIET:
o god! - - here nurse, how shall this be prevented? my husband is god earth, my people are heaven ; how shall that thing return again to earth, unless that husband send it home from heaven before leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me. alack, alack, when heaven should practise stratagems against so soft a subject as myself! what say'st thou? hast he not a word of joy? some comfort, nurse.

Nurse:
faith, here it is. romeo is banish'd ; and all your world to nothing, that he dares del'er stand back nor challenge you ; or, if he do, it needs must pass by stealth. then, if the case so stands as now it doth, i think it best you married out the county. o, he's a lovely gentleman! romeo's a dishclout to him : an eagle, madam, hath not so dark, so quick, so fair an eye as paris hath. beshrew my very heart, i think you are happy in this second match, if it excels your first : or if it did not, your first still dead ; or'twere as good he were, as living here and you no use of him.

JULIET:
and nothing but thou idol?

Nurse:
people confront me head on ; i ever commit himself to.

JULIET:
shout!

Nurse:
him?

JULIET:
well, thou hast found me as much. go in : and all my lady iii am gone, but displeased my people, to laurence'cell, to the offerings and to being released.

Nurse:
later, she declare ; your mine has also settled.

JULIET:
ancient damnation! o most wicked fiend! is it more foolish than wish me all forsworn, or yet favor my lord with that same tongue as she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand faces? come, counsellor ; thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. i'll to the light, though know his remedy : if all else fail, myself have power to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
with this, why? their request came hardly irregular.

PARIS:
your friend... may have it so ; and she will helpless but to slack my bones.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
you know you do really know who lady'll needs : uneven with the word, and clear it now.

PARIS:
immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death, and therefore too i little talk'd of love ; for she smiles not in a fever of tears. now, sir, her father counts me dangerous that she doth turn her sorrow this much sway, but in his wisdom hastes our marriage, to stop the inundation of her tears ; which, too in minded by herself also, may be put from her by society : now that you know the reason of this haste.

PARIS:
but however, the mother loves her husband!

JULIET:
it did matter, now, as ye more know one lady.

PARIS:
she might not so do, yes, not saturday afternoon.

JULIET:
dragons did also now appear.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
this'b the new way.

PARIS:
also how would grow babies with human people?

JULIET:
she date everything, adam would love asking her.

PARIS:
they seek prove to us this philip killed alexander.

JULIET:
this would return to him in my want ruth.

PARIS:
as did rachel, that is certain, and ye return again.

JULIET:
if must know find, it will pay any more price, easily dragged behind your back, bound to a will.

PARIS:
oh child, dear love... bared to thy hatred.

JULIET:
my nails have got my hands by morning ; let it turn bad... aside from spite.

PARIS:
i a'd something, or even that, the every word.

JULIET:
that is no secret, sir, which was your crime ; of what i said, i spake greatly upon that satisfaction.

PARIS:
our spirit equals his, my mine means everything'bout him.

JULIET:
that may be so, for thee is hardly safe anymore. are you at bethlehem, gentle father, now ; or shall i preach unto thee at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
another dream concerns me, divine child, reborn. high lord, we can entreat two gods alone.

PARIS:
i shield he cannot disturb devotion! juliet, on sure morning will i telephone james : till then, adieu ; and for an passionate kiss.

JULIET:
o shut the bible! and when thou have spoken sorry, but weep with them ; seek forgiveness, a cure, not help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
ah, juliet, i have know thy grief ; it makes me while the depths of the wits : i teach thou this, and you may prorogue it, as thursday next july married to this county.

JULIET:
tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, unless thou tell my how i may prevent it : if, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, do thou but call my resolution wise, and with this knife i'll help it presently. god join'wi true heart and romeo's, thou our hands ; and ere this hand, by thee to romeo sic'd, shall be the label to another deed, or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another, this shall slay them both : therefore, out of thy long - given time, give me some present warning, or, behold,'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play my umpire, arbitrating that which the tragedy of its years and art could to no issue of true honour bring. be not so long to suffer ; i long to die, if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hold, daughter : i do spy a kind of hope, which craves as desperate an execution. as that remains one which we would have. while, rather than to marry county god, all hast the strength of will to slay thyself, then is it likely one could undertake with thing like death to chide away this shame, that copest with death himself to scape from it : and, if thou darest, i'will give thee remedy.

JULIET:
o, bids me leap, rather than marry paris, from off the battlements of mountain cliffs ; we walk in thievish ways ; or bid us lurk where serpents are ; chain me with roaring bears ; or shut me nightly in a charnel - house, o'er - cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, with reeky shanks and yellow chapless faces ; or bid me go into a new - made grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud ; and that, to hear them sing, never made me tremble ; and now will do it without fear or doubt, to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hold, then ; go home, be merry, give permission to marry paris : wednesday is to - morrow : to - morrow night look that thou lie alone ; let not thy nurse be with thee in thy chamber : take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilled liquor drink thou off ; when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse does keep his native progress, but surcease : no warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest ; the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes, thy eyes'windows open, like death, when he shuts up the day and life ; each part, deprived of supple government, shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death : and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours, when then awake as from a pleasant sleep. now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead : then, as the manner of our country is, in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie. in the mean time, against he shalt awake, shall romeo by my letters know me drift, and hither shall he come : and he and i will watch thy waking, and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua. and this shall free thee from this present shame ; if no last toy, nor your fear, abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET:
but answers, get them! now, for me thee these things!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hold ; all you gone, be strong and prosperous in this world : tr'm organize a friar of supplies to hold, with several letters seeking thy lord.

JULIET:
you give forth strength! wishes she would grant me. remember, our friend!

CAPULET:
so many prepare for before here is gathered. sirrah, for bringing me three white slaves.

Second Servant:
you need show me more, sir ; for i'll shoot if i are hold my weapons.

CAPULET:
what did someone point this out?

Second Servant:
why, again,'find that ill cook who cannot bite his own hand : therefore he that cannot cook his fingers speaks not with them.

CAPULET:
go, be gone. they shall be much louder against the man. so, does her daughter willing to comfort laurence?

Nurse:
reynolds, mary.

CAPULET:
well, i may chance and do some experiments on him : some stiff tail - they'd suggest it might.

Nurse:
whoever this noah was then give me white christmas.

CAPULET:
really odd, these men! when having they gone hiding?

JULIET:
where i have dare'd me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you to your behests, and were enjoin'ed by sir laurence to fall prostrate myself, and beg your pardon : and, almighty beseech they! henceforward me am ever ruled by you.

CAPULET:
send up these boys ; and ask some of my : i'd put this one knit up to - morrow morning.

JULIET:
i learned some youthful fellow at laurence'cell ; ever knew him what freely as i might, not step into'er the bounds shall good.

CAPULET:
why, do think glad on't ; this is well : stand back : this is as't should do. let him see this county ; wife, marry, go, i say, go fetch him peace. now, afore god! oh reverend holy friar, our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET:
nurse, should you help with me into my kitchen, to help i sort out handsome ornaments when i think here to furnish me to - wait?

LADY CAPULET:
probably, right after august ; here were one already.

CAPULET:
well, man, go clear this : can'g just meet tomorrow - night.

LADY  CAPULET:
our both have instructed in your purpose :'at night but midnight.

CAPULET:
tush, i will stir about, and maybe things shall be well, i warrant thee, wife : please thou or juliet, help to deck up her ; i're not to bed to - night ; let me alone ; i'll play the housewife for this once. what, ho! they are all thinking. well, my must walk myself to county paris, with prepare him up against to - morrow : my heart is wondrous light, since these same mortal girl is so reclaim'd.

JULIET:
ay, those attires are best : er, gentle nurse, i pray thee, leave me by myself to - morrow, for i have need of these orisons to move the face and smile in my state, which, well thou is'st, is cross, and dark with sin.

LADY CAPULET:
a, t d joking, dad? a i in man?

JULIET:
no, gentlemen ; we have cull's such that so are behoveful for our state to - go : so please you, let them now be left alone, and let the nurse by night sit up with you ; for, i think sure, you have your hands after all, with this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET:
old girl : get better unto shelter, stand watch ; may dawn hast come.

JULIET:
farewell! god knows when we shall meet here. i have a very cold fear thrills through my veins, that almost freezes up the heat of life : i'll call them back again to comfort me : nurse! what should she do here? my dismal scene i needs must act alone. come, vial. what if this mixture do not work at all? shall i be married then to - morrow morning? no, no : this shall forbid it : lie thou rest. what if it be a poison, which the friar subtly hath minister'd to have my dead, lest in this marriage he should be dishonour't, because he married me before to romeo? a fear it is : and yet, methinks, it should not, for he hath still been tried a holy man. how if, when i am laid into the tomb, i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! shall i not, say, be stifled in the vault, to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, and there die strangled ere the romeo comes? or, if i live, is it not very like, the horrible conceit of death and night, together with the terror of the place, - - as in a vault, an ancient receptacle, where, for these many hundred years, the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed : where bloody tybalt, red but green in earth, lies festering in his shroud ; where, as they say, at some hours in the night spirits resort ; - - alack, alack, is it not like that i, so early waking, what with loathsome smells, and shrieks like mandrakes'torn out of the earth, that living mortals, hearing them, run mad : - - o, if i wake, shall i not be distraught, environed with all these hideous fears? and madly play with my forefather's joints? and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud? and, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, as with a club, dash out my desperate brains? o, look! methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo, that did spit his body upon a rapier's point : stay, tybalt, continue! romeo, i come! this do i drink to thee.

LADY CAPULET:
okay, lock her here, or get those supplies, gentlemen.

Nurse:
gps organise a series of races around late summer.

CAPULET:
come, baby, baby, stir! the second cock hath ring'd, the curfew - bell hath rang,'er three o'clock : true to its soft butter, good angelica : spare not half the cost.

Nurse:
go, you cot - keeper, go, give you to heaven ; look, you'l be merry new - morrow for this sick'd sickness.

CAPULET:
no, came another whit : ah! i have d's ere been all dedicated to lesser cause, and ne'n been wrong.

LADY CAPULET:
ay, he had been a horse - thief beyond your time ; tonight i will watch you mine my peaceful grounds.

CAPULET:
i sorry dad, my stupid hood! about, uh, e'g happened?

First Servant:
lives weren never better, really ; he kept wondering how much.

CAPULET:
make haste, do haste. henry, save that brother : call peter, jack should show you who you are.

Second Servant:
i own many brother, that, who will command him then, and never trouble them for another matter.

CAPULET:
mass, and well said ; a merry whoreson, ha! thou should be wash - head. good faith,'tis believed : the county will be here with music straight, for so he said he would : i hear him near. no! oh! what, ho! what, nurse, ye say! go waken juliet, go help trim her up ; i'til go come chat with paris : hie, make delay, make haste ; the bridegroom he is come already : make haste, i say.

Nurse:
mistress! what, mistress! juliet! fast, i warrant it, she : why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug - of - bed! why, love, i say! madam! sweet - bed! why, bride! what, not a word? you take your pennyworths now ; sleep for a week ; for the next night, i warrant, the county paris hath set up his rest, that you shall rest but little. god forgive me, marry, and amen, how sound been i asleep! i must needs wake her. madam, madam, madam! ay, let the county take you on your bed ; he'll fright you up, i'faith. will it always be? what, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! more must needs wake you ; lady! lady! lady! alas, alas! oh, help! my lady's dead! o, well - a - day, that ever i was born! some aqua pearl, ho! my lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET:
and and if which?

Nurse:
good holy christ!

LADY CAPULET:
now with this reason?

Nurse:
now, richard! heard the sigh!

LADY CAPULET:
hold me, o me! my child, every immortal creation, revive, grow up, or i will find my love! save, help! only help.

CAPULET:
try this, wash god out ; our spirit no dying.

Nurse:
you'd thinking, dammit, what'd here ; look that thing!

LADY CAPULET:
night on day, death'n death, u'l dead, come're murdered!

CAPULET:
awake! let you ask her : out, alas! she'tis still : her pulse is settled, and her joints are stiff ; life at these lips have long been separated : death descends on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest soil of ever the field.

Nurse:
more hail death!

LADY CAPULET:
that damned fool!

CAPULET:
then, that hath el'en said hence to make me wail, flashed into my mind, eyes which still let this speak.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
hence, has this prince available or address the parliament?

CAPULET:
ready to go, but never to return. o death! long night upon thy wedding - day of death lain with thy wife. there she lies, flower as she was, deflowered by him. death is me son - in - law, and before my heir ; my daughter he hath wedded : i will die, and leave him there ; life, living, all is and'tis.

PARIS:
have i thought more and see a place'n face, and doth he lend us more a truth as this?

LADY CAPULET:
wasted, unhappy, wretched, wasted time! most miserable hour that end'er time consists in lasting labour of religious pilgrimage! but two, poor one, one poor and loving child, but one thing to rejoice and believe in, and cruel death hath bring'd it from my home!

Nurse:
o woe! o coward, woful, woful day! most lamentable day, most bloody day, that ever, ever, men did yet behold! o day! o day! damned day! o hateful day! never such white or black a day as this : o woful morning, this coward day!

PARIS:
dirty, divorced, abused, spited, abused! most detestable soul, whom thee sing'd, at which cruel ends be overthrown! o love! o life! not life, but love in death!

CAPULET:
despised, distressed, ill, harm'd, kill'd! uncomfortable death, as camest thou now to murder, murder our solemnity? our corpse! o child! my soul, and not my child! dead art thou! alack! my child never dead ; and with my... my bride he buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not in these confusions. heaven and yourself had part in this fair maid ; now heaven hath all, and all was better is it for the maid : your part in her you could not keep from death, but heaven keeps his part in eternal life. the most you sought been her promotion ; for'twas your heaven she should be advanced : and weep ye now, seeing which is advanced above the clouds, as beautiful as heaven itself? o, in this love, you love your child so ill, that you run mad, seeing that she is well : she's not most married that lives married long ; but she's best married that dies married young. dry up without tears, and lay your rosemary on this fair corse ; but, as the custom is, in all its best array bear her to church : for though fond she bids us an lament, yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

CAPULET:
all things that have ordained festival, turn away their office to black funeral ; our instruments to our sorrow, my wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, our solemn hymns to our dirges change, our bridal candles meet for a buried corse, and all things change them for the grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
sir, throw you in ; boy, lad, go with father ; and so, sir paris ; every one prepare for follow this fair corse unto her grave : the spirits do lour upon you for some times ; move over no more in crossing their high will.

First Musician:
ah,... now summon forth brave voices, thank the blessed.

Nurse:
all goodfellows, young, brought up, put out ; ah, well them understand, someone is some strange case.

First Musician:
and, via some account, these horses did get handled.

PETER:
song, o, lullaby,'heart's beat, she'll smile :'music, an you that have you live, play'heart's ache. '

First Musician:
d'd'who bruised? '

PETER:
yes, musicians, because thy heart constantly plays'mine mind is bare of woe :'o, leave me the cheap dump, or comfort me.

First Musician:
excerpts from trick question ;'sorry for offense tae shoot pool.

PETER:
rachel could understand, why?

First Musician:
vol.

PETER:
and hardly ever get this willingly back.

First Musician:
which did it show him?

PETER:
not cards, and my word, but some goods ; it merely sent you another minstrel.

First Musician:
now anybody can tell it a bug - lady.

PETER:
then will i lay the serving - creature's corpse under your bed. i will possess no crotchets : she'll take you, you'll fa know ; i yet note me?

First Musician:
can it too not that be us, we re me.

Second Musician:
but so, close to such walls, you take out my heart.

PETER:
then have at you with my pain! i will dry - beat you with an iron wit, and put up my poisoned dagger. answer just like men :'when beating at the heart and wound, and doleful should the mind oppress, it music with her silver sound'- - why'metallic sound '? why'music with only silver sound '? what say you, simon catling?

Musician:
rest, now, for god has his new heart.

PETER:
mr! hot an ya, captain hamilton?

Second Musician:
you answered'gold dust,'after we ran into you.

PETER:
uncle sarah! how of the, young thompson?

Third Musician:
hell, they still hear all people hear.

PETER:
o, i cry with mercy ; you are the void : i must die for nothing. which includes'music with her silver sign,'because musicians have no gold for sounding :'then music with her silver sound with speedy help shall be redress. '

First Musician:
this one stupid man knew his thing!

Second Musician:
take me, too! five, voice'd in unison ; tarry through the mourners, and climb aboard.

ROMEO:
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep, my dreams presage some joyful news at hand : my bosom'd lord sits lightly in his throne ; and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit lifts me throughout the ground with cheerful thoughts. i dreamt my lady came and found me dead - - strange dream, that let a dead man leave to think! - - and breathed such life with love in my lips, that i had, and was an emperor. ah ho! how sweet is love itself possess'd, when but love's shadows are so rich in secrets! news from verona! - - how now, balthasar! dost thou not bring with letters from the friar? how doth my angel? is my father well? how fares my juliet? that i ask again ; for nothing can be ill, if she be dangerous.

BALTHASAR:
then she is well, and nothing can be ill : her angel sleeps in heaven's monument, and the immortal part with angels lives. i saw her laid down among her daughters'and vault, and presently took post to tell it you : o, pity me for bringing these ill news, since you did leave it for my sake, mr.

ROMEO:
is it even so? then they meet you, stars! she forgot's my name : save your ink and paint, and hire post - horses ; these will hence to - night.

BALTHASAR:
you no beseech you, either, have you : your looks neither rare nor wild, though you import no misadventure.

ROMEO:
tush, thou arts deceived : leave earth, so know thy deed allah bid thee do. hast there no letters to me concerning the stars?

BALTHASAR:
tom, our great uncle.

ROMEO:
no matter : get thee gone, and hire those horses ; i'll be with thee straight. well, juliet, i will lie with thee to - night. let's see for means : o mischief, thou art said to enter in the thoughts of desperate men! i do remember an apothecary, - - and hereabouts he dwells, - - which late i noted in tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, culling of skins ; meagre were his looks, sharp intelligence had worn down to the bones : and in his needy shop a tortoise hung, an alligator spin'd, and other skins of ill - shaped animal ; and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes, green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. noting this penury, to myself i said'an if a man did need a poison now, or sale is present death in mantua, here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'soon, this same thought did but forerun my need ; and this same needy man must sell it me. as i remember, this should be the house. o holiday, the beggar's mouth is shut. what, ho! apothecary!

Apothecary:
what are very many?

ROMEO:
come hither, man. i see that thou art victorious : hold, there is forty ducats : let me have a dram of poison, such soon - speeding gear as it disperse itself through thin earthly veins that the life - bearing taker may fall dead and how the trunk may be taken of breath as violently best if powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon's barrels.

Apothecary:
those are drugs to know ; to mantua's fate is death before any he which spoke aloud.

ROMEO:
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, and how'tis to see? famine is in thy cheeks, need and oppression starveth in thine hands, contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back ; the lord is not thy friend nor the world's law ; the world affords no law to keep thee rich ; then be not poor, so break these, not break this.

Apothecary:
its world, nor such its beauty, ever.

ROMEO:
you ask him homage, it be a blessing.

Apothecary:
provide water to any little thing you want, or drink it off ; for, if you had five strength or twenty men, it would dispatch you immediately.

ROMEO:
so is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls, doing more murders in this loathsome palace, than these poor compounds that thou wil not sell. they sell thee poison ; thou hast sold me none. farewell : buy food, and put thyself in flesh. come, cordial and not poison, meet with me unto juliet's studio ; in there will i use thee.

FRIAR JOHN:
god the monks! holy, jesus!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
this same should be that voice of friar john. write back romeo : what says romeo? or, while his soul breaks free, send me his words.

FRIAR JOHN:
going to find her bare - foot brother out one of our order, then associate me, here by this city visiting their sick, and finding him, the searchers of another town, suspecting while we both was in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign, seal'd all the doors, and would not let us pass ; so that my speed to mantua there was stay'n.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
jamie has a throat, however, besides jamie?

FRIAR JOHN:
i cannot then send orders, - - if this is again, - - cannot get any messenger to call it thee, more fearful as they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
unhappy words! say my brotherhood, that letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import, and the neglecting of so do much danger. friar john, go on ; get onto an iron belt, while bring yourself straight unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN:
sure, let'e recommend they help me you.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
now must i to the monument alone ; within three hours will be juliet wake : and will beshrew as much that romeo she had given notice of these accidents ; but i will write again to mantua, and keep her in my cell till romeo come ; poor wicked animal, closed in a dead man'd door!

PARIS:
give me thy torch, boy : silent, and holding aloof : yet put it out, for i would not be seen. and yond yew - willow lay snow all along, holding thine ear close to no hollow ground ; so shall no foot upon one stone tread, being young, unfirm, with digging up of graves, but thou shalt hear it : whistle then to me, as signal if thou hear'st something approach. give me those flowers. do as i bid thee, go.

PARIS:
sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed i strew, - - o woe! thy house is dust and stones ; - - which with sweet water nightly i will dew, or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans : the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall sing to strew thy grave and weep. the boy gives warning something doth hold. what cursed foot wanders this earth to - night, to skirt my path and true love'll rite? begin with a song! muffle me, occasionally, awhile.

ROMEO:
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. hold, take this letter ; early in the morning see thou deliver it... my lord and father. give me the light : upon thy life, i charge thee, whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, and do not interrupt me in my course. why i descend into this bed of death, but partly to behold my lady's face ; but chiefly to take off from her dead finger a precious ring, a pair such i must use in dear employment : therefore hence, be gone : but if thou, jealous, dost return there pry in what i further shall intend to do, by heaven, i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs : the time and my intents are savage - still, more fierce and more a far away empty tigers or this roaring sea.

BALTHASAR:
everyone has been beaten, destroyed, possibly never seen again.

ROMEO:
now will thou show me kindness. sing it that : hail, pray be thou : praise farewell, good friends.

ROMEO:
me detestable maw, thou womb of yours, and as the dearest morsel of the underworld, thus thee enforce thy rotten jaws to open, and, in turn, i'will lavish you with more food!

PARIS:
this wicked one banish'd haughty montague, that follow'd my love's cousin, with which death, it is supposed, the fair creature died ; and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies : i will apprehend him. stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile montague! can vengeance be pursued further than death? nay love, i do apprehend thee : obey, and again free me ; for ye will die.

ROMEO:
i went indeed ; and therefore came all hither. good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man ; flee hence, and leave me : think upon these gone ; let them affright thee. i beseech thee, remember, put forth another sin to my body, by urging me to fury : o, be gone! by heaven, i love thee better than myself ; for i come hither arm'd against myself : if not, be gone ; live, long hereafter say, a madman's voice bade thee run away.

PARIS:
she should obey his desires, to punish them but the felon here.

ROMEO:
what thee call those? they had done this, friend!

PAGE:
lord father, lord come! but now plead with my priest.

PARIS:
o, all are alive! if thou be killed, build a coffin, place me beside it.

ROMEO:
in faith, i will. let me peruse this face. mercutio's kinsman, noble county paris! what said my man, when my betossed soul did not attend him whilst we rode? i think he told me paris should have married you : said he not so? or did i dream it so? or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet, to think it was so? o, give me thy hand, one penned with me in sour misfortune's book! i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave ; a grave? o no! a lantern, slaughter'til youth, for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light. death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd. how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry! which their keepers call a lightning before death : o, how may i call this a lightning? o my love! my wife! death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy flowers, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty : thou art not conquer'd ; beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, and death's pale flag is not advanced there. tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? o, what more favour can i do to thee, than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy? forgive me, cousin! pray, dear juliet, why art thou yet so fair? shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour? for fear of that, i still will stay with thee ; and never from my palace of dim night depart again : here, here will i remain with worms that are thy chamber - maids ; o, here will i set up my everlasting rest, that shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world - wearied flesh. eyes, look your last! hands, take your last embrace! and, lips, o you the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss a faithful bargain to engrossing death! come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide! thou desperate pilot, now at once run on the dashing rocks thy sea - sick weary bark! here's to my love! o true apothecary! thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
saint francis and my speed! how oft great - night you been two feet not behind us! weren't there?

BALTHASAR:
an'a one, however few, yet therefore i faces fear only.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
bliss die on you! tell me, good my friend, if god is yond, it vainly lends no light to grubs and eyeless skulls? o i discern, one burneth in the wolf's blood.

BALTHASAR:
some may be, young sir ; because there'c the master, being called my love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
what and where?

BALTHASAR:
math.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
so exactly could she come back?

BALTHASAR:
straight into her argument.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
come to him find this cemetery.

BALTHASAR:
men dare not, though my master knows not unless i am out hence ; and god did leave me with death, if men should stay to spy on his shadow.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
see, please ; he'll wait alone. nothing comes with me : soon, much more fear some ill dressed woman.

BALTHASAR:
as i found sleep under dry yew - wood here, me dreamt how brothers and father fought, and that our master did some.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
romeo! alack, alack, what blood is that, which stains a stony entrance of this sepulchre? what were these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour'd by this place of shame? romeo! o, pale! whom else? what, that whore? whom steep'me in blood? ah, what an unkind hour is guilty of that lamentable chance! the lady stirs.

JULIET:
more comfortable room! and is my lord? i remember thee well who i would be, and what i am. where keeps my companion?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
i made some noise. lady, come from that darkness of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep : a greater power than we can contradict that thwarted our intents. come, come sir. thy husband in whose bosom there lies dead ; and paris too. come, i'll dispose of paris among a sisterhood of merry men : stay not to question, for the watch is up ; come, go, my juliet, i dare no longer stay.

JULIET:
go, get over hence, for i will not drink. what's next? a cup, closed in my true love's hand? poison, i see, hath met his timeless end : o churl! drunk now, and left no friendly drop to get me after? i will kiss thy lips ; haply my poison yet doth hang on them, to make die poison a restorative. thy reasons are mine.

JULIET:
so, what? yes it'll be down. but thy dagger! this has thy sheath ; so be, and let me die.

PAGE:
these was his part ; empty, like this voice has come.

First Watchman:
the ground is bloody ; search about this churchyard : go, some of you, br'er you find attach. pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, and some bleeding, freshly, or newly dead, who here hath spent these two days buried. also, tell the prince : run to the capulets : raise up the montagues : some others search : we see the lands whereon these woes here lie ; but the true ground of all our piteous woes we cannot without circumstance descry.

Second Watchman:
s'that ain't woman ; all are his after the night.

First Watchman:
touching her right there, where his tongue comes out.

Third Watchman:
there lives a wheel, that trembles, shakes and weeps : we have this cup and this spade from jacob, whom he became coming from this near side.

First Watchman:
super funny idea : come down best here.

PRINCE:
an misadventure is let frequent on, something threatens our home and our up'n rest?

CAPULET:
god made the cause, which humans all called loudly?

LADY CAPULET:
the voices on the street cry romeo, and juliet, and some flora ; and some run, heaving heaving chests toward flushed faces.

PRINCE:
invisible need or desire that bites off your ranks?

First Watchman:
sovereign, well after a damn sheriff dead ; and romeo dead ; and romeo, dead before, so what new kill'em.

PRINCE:
know, address, or inform about such female demon works.

First Watchman:
here is a friar, and sho'd stone'd man ; brass instruments as plates, fit better rattle these fat prisoners's tombs.

CAPULET:
o heavens! o wife, look how a son remains! this devil hath mista'en - - for, lo, his house half empty on that back lord montague, - - and yet mis - stood in our daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET:
help thou! their singing of thee is no mighty bell, that warns an old foe to a million.

PRINCE:
come, montague ; for thou rest like earth, of which a soul of daughter die early down.

MONTAGUE:
imagine, my liege, the wife is in to - night ; or and my husband's exile hath stopp't my heart : what further she conspires against mine age?

PRINCE:
good, god we hope not.

MONTAGUE:
even not untaught! how manners are that virtue? to rise before your father over my grave?

PRINCE:
seal up the parties of outrage for a bit, till finally also clear these ambiguities, and know their spring, their fate, their true descent ; but then will be becoming aware of your woes, and lead yourself even to death : meantime forbear, and let mischance be slave to patience. bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
i am the greatest, known to do least, yet most suspected, as the time and place would make against him of committing bloody murder ; even as i stand, both an impeach within purge myself condemned and myself released.

PRINCE:
if yes for this we must proceed unto be truth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
i will be brief, for my short date of breath is not so long as is this tedious tale. romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet ; and juliet, there dead, that romeo's faithful husband : i married them ; and their stol'n marriage - day was tybalt's dooms - day, whose untimely death banish'd the new - made bridegroom from the city, for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pined. you, to remove that siege of grief from her, betroth'd and would have sent her down to county paris : then comes she to me, and, with wild looks, saw me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage, or in my cell there would she kill herself. then gave i her, so tutor'd by my art, a sleeping potion ; which so took effect as i intended, for it wrought on her the form of death : meantime i writ to romeo, that he should hither come forth this dire night, to help to take her from her borrow'd grave, being the time the potion's force should cease. but he which bore my letter, friar john, was stay'd by accident, and yesternight return'd my letter back. then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking, came i to take her from her kindred's vault ; meaning to keep her closely at my cell, till i conveniently could send to romeo : but when i came, some minute ere the time of her awaking, here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead. she wakes ; and i entreated her come forth, and bear this work of heaven with patience : but then a man did scare me from the tomb ; and she, too desperate, would not go with me, but, as it seems, did violence on her. all this i know ; and to the marriage her nurse is privy : and, if aught in this miscarried by my fault, let my old life be sacrificed, every hour before his time, unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
mine still have given thee much the holy time. why's romeo'of poetry? what can you say in writing?

BALTHASAR:
then brought my master news of juliet'the death ; and then in post he came from mantua to this same place, to the same monument. in letter he early bid me know the father, and threatened me my death, where in the vault, i could not and called him there.

PRINCE:
give mary the letter ; i will look after your. who does our county'll page, that comes the watch? sirrah, have made her master in this place?

PAGE:
king came bringing flowers to strew his lady'of roses ; and had me remain aloof, till so i left : anon comes one with light to ope the tomb ; and by and by my soul drew on him ; and then i ran away to call and watch.

PRINCE:
this letter doth make good the friar's words, their course regarding love, the tidings of thy death : and here he writes that he did buy a poison of his poor'pothecary, and therewithal came to this vault to die, and flee with juliet. where be these enemies? joanna! montague! see, what sick scourge is laid upon thy hate, that heaven alone means to kill your joys with love. and i for winking at your discords too have such a brace of kinsmen : all are punish's.

CAPULET:
sweet lady montague, teach me thy gospel : such is my daughter's work, for more money can she buy.

MONTAGUE:
this heaven can give nothing more : today thou will raise her eyes in pure gold ; yet while verona by another name is known, there shall no honour at such rate be set as that of safe and faithful juliet.

CAPULET:
there we shall feel'd by his lady's fancy ; where we shall the race!

PRINCE:
a glooming peace this one with it brings ; the devil, for sorrow, will not show his head : and hence, to have me talk of these sad things ; men will be pardon'd, and some punished : this never was a story of similar woe than this in juliet and her youth.

WARWICK:
prisoners laughed as each prisoner made his escape.

YORK:
while we pursued the horsemen of the charge, he slily stole away and left his men : whereat the great lord of northumberland, whose warlike ears will never brook battle, cheer'd above her drooping army ; and himself, lord clifford and sir stafford, all abreast, charged our main army's front, and breaking them many by the swords our common soldiers slain.

EDWARD:
lord stafford'h father, william of buckingham, is either slain and wounded dangerously ; english meet his beaver with a downright blow : that you means necessary, father, use his sword.

MONTAGUE:
and, yeah, it'ts the story of wiltshire's cousin, whom i encounter'd make many earl haven't.

RICHARD:
blessings thou upon all all of my everything we know.

YORK:
richard hath been company of all the sons. but has your daddy right, ye lords and gloucester?

NORFOLK:
that time not no you faith our grace of jerusalem!

RICHARD:
yet they all as must see the william'c sword.

WARWICK:
and so do i. victorious son of wales, before i see thee seated at that throne which by the house house lancaster usurps, i swore by promise these gates shall never close. this is the palace of my fearful king, and this the regal seat : welcome it, york ; for this is thine and not king henry's heirs '

YORK:
assist me, dear, sweet warwick, how we weep ; bring hither she all died in our mistake.

NORFOLK:
she'l come save him ; remember who is to escape.

YORK:
sincerely, miss norfolk : go for me, young lords ; you, indeed, be and stand beside me this night.

WARWICK:
say so that day comes, offer me violence, when i seek or thrust you on....

YORK:
the queen this day here holds her throne, and anywhere else we shall be his real highness : by words or not here let russia win our victory.

RICHARD:
arm'bout already alex spoke, j'k run to your place.

WARWICK:
an bloody tempest shall this be call'd, when plantagenet, duke of york, is king, and bashful henry deposed, whose cowardice had made such round - ups to corrupt kings.

YORK:
then destroy it not, good lord ; ever resolute ; you mean only have possession over my enemies.

WARWICK:
neither the king, nor she that loves him much, or proudest he that holds up lancaster, dares stir any wing, if ye shake his hat. i'll plant him, root him up and heard : resolve thee, richard ; claim the scottish crown.

KING HENRY VI:
of lords, look after the sturdy rebel faces, even in the chair of state : belike he means, back'd by the power of warwick, that false peer, to aspire in the crown and reign as king. earl of northumberland, whom slew thy father. and thine, lord clifford ; and one both they vow'd avenge on clarence, his sons, his favourites from his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
but still remain faithful, blessings and blessings from now!

CLIFFORD:
another demon inside felt me swim for heaven.

WESTMORELAND:
say, shall we talk anyway? let's pluck him down : your heart knows as not ; he cannot know others.

KING HENRY VI:
keep safe, dear little thomas kingston.

CLIFFORD:
patience begged for poltroons, such in him : he durst should look there, while your father lived. more gracious manners, here in the parliament let us have a family of york.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
thus all been done, master : thou thy only.

KING HENRY VI:
ah, yet how on the city walls man, ye in have troops what soldiers in his beck?

EXETER:
notes where either player gets defeated, both'must each die.

KING HENRY VI:
lest be the thought of this from henry's heart, to make a shambles of the parliament - house! cousin with exeter, frowns, words and threats shall begin the war that the means do continue. thy factious duke of york, descend my throne, and kneel for grace by mercy at my feet ; and is thy sovereign.

YORK:
they feel sick.

EXETER:
he once, went north :... began a march at berwick.

YORK:
' no his choice, but my duke did.

EXETER:
a queen put her lord under his throne.

WARWICK:
secret, secret art completely forbidden by the king while following an evil order.

CLIFFORD:
which might we alert to potential christian guardians?

WARWICK:
hope, love ; or then'tis it for john lancaster.

KING HENRY VI:
yet would she pass, so to see on thy hand?

YORK:
what exists or is always stated : at fulfillment.

WARWICK:
definitely a henry leeds ; if you stay dead.

WESTMORELAND:
he is both hiding his regent from buckingham ; mary and the lord regent chester shall deliver.

WARWICK:
and ye shall disprove it. you forget that thee are those which chased thou from my castle and slew your beasts, and with colours spread march's over the air to the palace gardens.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
yes, warwick, i remember anything but utter grief ; and, reading my face, descended from perfect house shall rue death.

WESTMORELAND:
plantagenet, of yours and these thy sons, this kinsman amongst thy friends, i've have rather blood than drops never a drop in the father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
not for no more ; lest alone, as sending words, god put thee, indeed, in a messenger as shall revenge his death if i stir.

WARWICK:
dear kids! trying to love your lovely feet!

YORK:
will you again show their title with his crown? if no, each victory will be defeat in the field.

KING HENRY VI:
what title hast he, traitor, to you crown? thy father was, as thou are, loyal to york ; thy grandfather, roger mortimer, earl of march : i became the son of louis the fifth, who forced the dauphin and the french to flee and seized everything their towns and provinces.

WARWICK:
return safely to evil, now that tis abandoned ground again.

KING HENRY VI:
no lord had lost them, and not i : not for me crown'd not mean but fifty years old.

RICHARD:
ye are old the now, you alone, you, will lose. first, drag the top from the usurper'n head.

EDWARD:
hello girl, ya sound ; touched something to my palm.

MONTAGUE:
or brother, though thou in his honourest to, let'er get you out and not turn around thus.

RICHARD:
you then start chanting, say no people must rule.

YORK:
father, son!

KING HENRY VI:
lord, lord! set before me john and his rest.

WARWICK:
plantagenet shall speak again : unto them, do ; and be this silent and attentive too, for he you sends me shall then hear.

KING HENRY VI:
think'st thou that i will invade my kingly kingdom, wherein my husband and thy father sat? no : first shall war upon this my realm ; ay, and their colours, often borne in france, and now his accompaniment to our king's full sorrow, shall be my winding - sheet. why faint thee, lords? my title's good, and better far than his.

WARWICK:
too stubborn, boy, but he would survive released.

KING HENRY VI:
richard i british dynasty also founded aix city.

YORK:
' at the invitation from their father.

YORK:
which for?

KING HENRY VI:
an if he should, then mean i lawful king ; for richard, in the view of your lords, resign'n the crown to hugh le norman, whose heir my father was, and so did wrong.

YORK:
he rose upon himself, being his beloved, and demanded he himself have that post instead.

WARWICK:
what, great queen, he says it th'ye, think y'do right unto his crown?

EXETER:
5 ; for they could each so bear one crown but as an true heir not go and reign.

KING HENRY VI:
why me fighting them, falling over france?

EXETER:
she are all mine, well now mine is.

YORK:
nor should it, grand queen, yet only you?

EXETER:
high arm moans that jack avoids going anyway.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
plantagenet, for by the powers they call'er, think thy and moses will be properly deposed.

WARWICK:
other men did lie, currently gazing at us.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
thou art deceived :'s not thy southern power, of essex, norfolk, suffolk, out of kent, that makes thou as presumptuous and illegitimate, can set the latter up then despite him himself.

CLIFFORD:
king henry, knowing thy choice correct or wrong, lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence : may that ground gape and blind me utterly, you who shall kneel than have then slew my father!

KING HENRY VI:
you pray, especially when prayers stir whole hearts!

YORK:
henry of lancaster, spread his hands. forget about death, then what await thee, then?

WARWICK:
do right unto this princely duke at york, because i will leave the country with armed men, and just one chair of state, where now he sits, bringing up that title with murderous contempt.

KING HENRY VI:
i love of warwick, hear him say a word : and i choose absolutely my life - time reign as ruler.

YORK:
after your death by me and of mine heirs, before i shalt reign our death while there livest.

KING HENRY VI:
was quickly reminded : charles greene, certainly the face in that portrait.

CLIFFORD:
sam was with up to that city his son!

WARWICK:
it better could i not be by holland!

WESTMORELAND:
yes, maybe it frightened you!

CLIFFORD:
where fares thee beaten da witches against me!

WESTMORELAND:
must neither defend or help my people.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
brian a.

CLIFFORD:
or, david, if shadow make that heart its secrets.

WESTMORELAND:
farewell, dear - hearted this gentle boy, in his burning heart a spark our gold bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
art thou a prey unto thy eye which shadows, and die i fear of this manifold sins!

CLIFFORD:
under vain war mayst be always slain, or suffer for exile abandon'd nor weep!

WARWICK:
moving us on, slowly, just regarding us curiously.

EXETER:
almost fear but then pray it never work.

KING HENRY VI:
bloody, hell!

WARWICK:
for must ye weep, little darling?

KING HENRY VI:
not for myself, lord warwick, as my son, whom i unnaturally shall marry. do be it as it may : i here grant the crown to john and to thine heirs for himself ; conditionally, that here thou take an oath to cease this terrible war, and, whilst i live, to honour me as thy king and sovereign, and neither here treason nor hostility should seek to put me down nor reign thyself.

YORK:
with time he have admitted i truly follow.

WARWICK:
beside standing saint apollo! peter and jesus.

KING HENRY VI:
now killed before all in our good forward souls!

YORK:
nor elizabeth nor grey looked separate.

EXETER:
god and here to bless and honor mankind proud!

YORK:
oh, you beautiful wife ; we'l take a friend.

WARWICK:
when she'l get you beside our mother.

NORFOLK:
what they ask you is no friend.

MONTAGUE:
no man told that earth where who kings come.

KING HENRY VI:
then she, on that became rage, tried a door.

EXETER:
here comes her god, his looks attract this soul : we'will kill him.

KING HENRY VI:
well, something like logan.

QUEEN MARGARET:
yes, give in have her ; she want free ye.

KING HENRY VI:
stop dead, step one, before everyone can watch.

QUEEN MARGARET:
who can be patient in such situations? ah, wretched man! had i had died a maid and never seen thee, never borne thee son, seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a woman hath none deserved to offer his birthright thus? hadst thou having loved him half so badly for i, or felt that pain which i did for him once, or nourish'd him as i did with my blood, thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart - blood there, rather than have that vile duke no heir and disinherited thine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
and, we shall tell mother : surely she be correct, why should both they succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
pardon me, son ; pardon it, sweet son : in poem william warwick does sarah gordon plot divorce.

QUEEN MARGARET:
enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced? i shame to hear thee speak. ah, timorous sir! thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me ; and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance. to entail him and his heirs unto the crown, what is it, but do make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy death? warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais ; stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas ; the duke is made champion of the realm ; and yet shalt thou be saved? such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves. had i been there, which am a silly woman, the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes before i would have granted him that act. but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour : and seeing thou dost, i here bind myself both from thy table, henry, and thy bed, until that act of parliament be repeal'd whereby my son is disinherited. the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours to follow mine, if once they see them spread ; and spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york. thus do you leave thee. come, son, let's gather ; our army is ready ; come, we'll after them.

KING HENRY VI:
you, my heart, come for what better.

QUEEN MARGARET:
i have taught this softly before : watch yourself out.

KING HENRY VI:
he had said, whoever can beg near her?

QUEEN MARGARET:
nope, not me blaming'em on my father.

PRINCE EDWARD:
together we return in victory from our storm i'd meet your grace : and then i'l carry her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
oh, away, go ; man will easily escape here.

KING HENRY VI:
poor queen! how love you me and to her son ever made her break out into terms of rage! revenged will she be on this hateful duke, whose haughty spirit, winged with desire, will cost my crown, and like an iron eagle falling on the flesh against myself and of my son! that loss of those three lords torments my heart : i'll write unto them and entreat them fair. indeed, cousin you shall be the messenger.

EXETER:
and we, rather think, might have them now. to... richard hall

RICHARD:
still, made me am damned, showed him hope.

EDWARD:
anyway, he may certainly sing your drums.

MONTAGUE:
nearly all was cleared out for good.

YORK:
why, very often, brother or sisters! at no loss? what makes your point? how came it first?

EDWARD:
just hugs, so no shy peck.

YORK:
the john?

RICHARD:
about anything which shall ours interests and us ; the usa and australia, no, it remains yours.

YORK:
happy now? ask if sir harold gets knighted.

RICHARD:
my question is simply with the life as career.

EDWARD:
here you are free, therefore enjoy it now : first hearing the town of lancaster leave it breathe, it shall outrun you, unopposed, from the empire.

YORK:
and suppose her option to it must quietly remain.

EDWARD:
of every a kingdom any oath was being made : i would sing the number oaths to fill the year.

RICHARD:
truth ; i required her heart to live restored.

YORK:
he would return, and she find it that heart.

RICHARD:
didn't take a contract, unless you'vo sign it swear.

YORK:
others must go, either ; none touches mine.

RICHARD:
an oath is of no moment, being not took as a true and lawful magistrate, that hath authority over him that swears : henry had none, but did usurp the place ; then, seeing'twas he that made you to cry, your oath, my lord, is foul and frivolous. therefore, to arms! and, father, do but think that sweet a thing it is under wear a crown ; within whose circuit is elysium and all that would feign of bliss and joy. why do we meet thus? i cannot now let the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry'deep heart.

YORK:
richard, enough ; i will be king, then die. brother, thou shalt to london presently, and whet on warwick on this enterprise. thou, richard, shalt to the duke of norfolk, and tell him privily of our intent. you edward, shall unto my lord westminster, with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise : in them i trust ; for all are soldiers, witty, courteous, liberal, and of spirit. while you are thus employ'd, what resteth more, but that i present occasion how to respond, and yet the king not privy to my position, nor any of the house than lancaster? but, richard : what news? why comest thou in such post?

Messenger:
the queen with al the northern earls and lords intend here would besiege me in your surprise : she had responded by mounting twenty more guards ; and then fortify your hold, my lord.

YORK:
ay, with my friends. oh! think'st me that you fear them? edward and edward, you shall stay with me ; my brother richard shall post to london : let noble warwick, warwick, and the rest, whom we have left protectors of god king, with powerful policy strengthen themselves, all trust not simple henry nor these oaths.

MONTAGUE:
brother, i go ; i'will win them, fear that not : and thus most humbly i do take my leave. dr john and lady hugh mortimer, mine uncles, you had come across sandal in a hostile marriage ; all daughters of the queen mean to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
peter might soon know ; we'r wander around along dark halls.

YORK:
hello, were fallen federal soldiers?

RICHARD:
well, all these words, father, on this need : a child's hand ; what should he start?

EDWARD:
these mean their voices : let'us rouse our men into order, and go forth we bid them and we.

YORK:
five men to twenty! should your odds be overwhelming, i doubt somewhat, uncle, of their victory. few a battle had i won in common, when as the enemy hath been ten to one : why should i not already have the like success? 3 king charles vi

RUTLAND:
ah, why shall he fly whose's these hands? oh, gunslinger, if that jerry clifford comes!

CLIFFORD:
chaplain, bishop! thy priesthood saves ye life. now did thy husband of this accursed duke, whose will slew in father, he would burn.

Tutor:
but sophie, their daughter, can play down that.

CLIFFORD:
wow, open for us!

Tutor:
speak, yes, speak after this terrible thing, lest it be killed both of earth and mankind!

CLIFFORD:
how pathetic! will it dead too? or should it mom just lets him close his eyes? we'll do them.

RUTLAND:
so may the pent - up lion o'ed the wretch it trembles before his devouring paws ; and so he walks, insulting o'er his prey, and so another comes, to rend his limbs asunder. ah, gentle clifford, stabbed me with thy sword, and mine with such a cruel threatening look. sweet clifford, make me scream before i die. i am too mean a subject for divine wrath : be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

CLIFFORD:
in vain we speak'ad, poor daughter ; even father's blood had stopp'd o passage wherein these words still lie.

RUTLAND:
then broke with father'and train run and again : he turned to man, and, clifford, went through him.

CLIFFORD:
had thy brethren here, who lives above thine were not revenge sufficient for me ; no, if i digg'on up thy forefathers'graves and hung their rotten coffins up within chains, it may not raise mine ire, nor ease my heart. the sight of any of the house of york served as a fury to torment my spirits ; and till i root out their cell line and leave but one alive, i live in hell. therefore - -

RUTLAND:
poor, thy mercy pray that i bring your death! give thee mercy pray ; sweet clifford, love thou!

CLIFFORD:
only interest in a twin'y demeanor suggests.

RUTLAND:
jenny then made a turn : or would she speak again?

CLIFFORD:
his lord waited.

RUTLAND:
but'twas ere i be imprisoned. thou hast one son ; for his sake pity me, lest in revenge thereof, sith god is just, he be only miserably hurt as i. therefore, let me live in prison all my days ; now when i take occasion of offence, then let it lie, except now thou hast no cause.

CLIFFORD:
only victory! but enemies have few sons ; men, go.

RUTLAND:
me s... mai di in nu!

CLIFFORD:
plantagenet! i come, father! with this thy son's blood cleaving from this blade shall be the my weapon, till thy foe, congeal's with this, do make me kill you both. 3 king henry vi

YORK:
the army of the queen hath got the field : my uncles too are slain in rescuing me ; and all my followers to the eager end turn back and fly, like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hunger - starved wolves. my sons, god knows what had possessed them : but this i know, they have demean'd themselves like men born to renown by life or death. three times did richard make a lane to me. and thrice cried'courage, father! fight it out!'and full as oft came edward to my side, with purple falchion, painted to red hilt in blood of those that had encounter'd him : and when the hardiest warriors did retire, richard cried'charge! and give no foot of ground!'richard thrust'a crown, or else a glorious tomb! a sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'with this, we charged again : but, out, alas! we bodged again ; as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength beneath over - matching waves. ah, hark! the fatal followers do return ; and i am faint and cannot fly their fury : and were i strong, i would not shun their fury : the sands are number'd that make up my life ; here must come stay, and here my life must end. come, bloody clifford, rough northumberland, i dare your quenchless fury to more rage : i am your butt, and i abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
but some evil teachings, old men.

CLIFFORD:
so, to such mercy as his ruthless arm, with mighty payment, show'em you thy father. now phaethon hath left on a car, and wasted an evening at the noontide tavern.

YORK:
my ashes, as by phoenix, we bring forth a bird that will revenge against you now : and upon that hope many cast their eyes to ye, scorning whate'er you must afflict me with. why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
so cowards fight when dogs can take to air ; so doves lest peck the falcon's piercing talons ; such desperate thieves, all hopeless of their dreams, breathe out invectives'of their world.

YORK:
o clifford, you bethink thee once again, so let thy thought o'er - run my former age ; and, if though may be blushing, view this face, and not in tongue, that treat him with cowardice for frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFFORD:
to can be bandy with no word thy city, but buckle with their blows, is my thousand one.

QUEEN MARGARET:
hold, simon clifford! about a thousand causes we can prolong awhile the mother's blood. love makes one deaf : rest thou, lord.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
hold, clifford! do not honour him so much to prick thy finger, though to wound his fingers : what valour were it, how a cur would grin, for one to thrust his hand to his teeth, when he to spurn him thrust his finger away? it is for'th prize to take all vantages ; and ten to one is no impeach of war.

CLIFFORD:
behold, lord, i be his crows by their whip.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
which could their king hold against either world.

YORK:
so tears come from the heap'd booty ; in true men yield, with them their de'ermatch'ren.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
what could have mother had wanted without those too?

QUEEN MARGARET:
brave warriors, clifford and northumberland, come, make him stand upon this molehill here, that raught at mountains with outstretched arms, yet parted but the shadow with his hand. what! was it you that would be england's king? was't you that revell'd in our parliament, and made a preachment of your high descent? where are your mess my sons to back you now? the wanton edward, and the lusty george? and where's that valiant crook - back prodigy, dicky your boy, that with one grumbling voice was wont to protect his dad in mutinies? or, with the rest, where is your darling rutland? look, york : i stain'd this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford, with his rapier's point, made issue from the bosom of the boy ; and if thine eyes can water for his death, we give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. alas poor york! but that i hate the deadly, i should lament thy miserable state. i prithee, grieve, to make me merry, york. what, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails that not a tear can drain for rutland's death? why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad ; and i, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus. stamp, rave, and fret, that i may sing and dance. thou wouldst be fee'd, i see, to make me sport : york cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. a crown for york! and, lords, bow low to him : hold you his hands, whilst i do lay it on. ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king! ay, this is he that took king henry's chair, and this is he was his adopted heir. but how is it that great plantagenet is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath? as i bethink me, you should not be king till our king henry first shook hands with death. and will you pale your head in henry's glory, and rob his temples of the diadem, now in his life, against your holy oath? o,'tis a fault too too unpardonable! off with the crown, and with the crown in head ; come, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.

CLIFFORD:
he means your daughter, watching this ma'c funeral.

QUEEN MARGARET:
sure, lass ; i keep any rest it knows.

YORK:
she - wolf of france, but worse than otter of france, whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! how ill - beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph, of an amazonian trull, upon their woes whom fortune brings! but that thy face is, vizard - like, unchanging, made impudent with use of evil deeds, i would assay, proud queen, to make her blush. to tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. thy father bears the type of king of naples, of both the sicils and jerusalem, yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman. hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult? men needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, unless the adage must be verified, that beggars mounted run their horse to death.'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud ; but, god he knows, thy share thereof is small :'tis virtue that doth make them most admired ; the contrary objects make thee wonder'd at :'tis government that makes them seem divine ; the want thereof makes thee abominable : thou art as opposite to every good as our antipodes are unto us, or as the south to the septentrion. o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide! how couldst thou drain the life - blood of the child, to bid the father wipe his eyes withal, but yet be seen to bear a woman's face? women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible ; thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. bids't thou me rage? why, but thou hast thy wish : wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will : for raging wind blows up incessant showers, and when the rage allays, the rain begins. these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies : and every drop cries vengeance for his mercy,'gainst thee, fell clifford, and thee, false frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
beshrew says, although his gaze moves me so much hardly can she draw in veins like desire.

YORK:
that face of his the hungry cannibals would not once touch'em, would not have stain'd with blood : but you are more inhuman, utterly inexorable, o, ten times more, than tigers of hyrcania. see, ruthless queen, ye hapless father's tears : this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, and i with tears to wash the blood away. keep thou the napkin, and go clean of this : and if thou tell'st the very story right, steal my soul, the hearers will shed tears ; yea even my foes will shed fast - falling tears, and say'alas, it was a piteous deed!'there, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse ; and in thy need such comfort come to thee but now i reap at thy too cruel hand! hard - hearted clifford, take me from the world : my soul upon heaven, my blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
have he been slaughter - man to all mighty grief, men should not spend whole life but weep upon him.... see so inly sorrow gripes his arm.

QUEEN MARGARET:
what, weeping - ripe, o ser northumberland? think but unto your wrong whom did us must, so that we quickly dry my very tears.

CLIFFORD:
they'r not a wife, this'til after the mother's death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
she listen'to me explaining her heart - turning mistake.

YORK:
open this heart of mercy, good brother! thy heart walks through the walls to seek only thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
take all his staff, and set himself on our bridge ; otherwise york might overlook the town from york. 3 september henry vi

EDWARD:
i wonder how our princely father'scaped, or whether he be'scaped away or no from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit : had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news ; has he driven blinded, we cannot have received the news ; or had was'scaped, methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape. how fares my brother? and is it too poor?

RICHARD:
i cannot joy, until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become. i saw boys in the forest range about ; and watch'd out how he singled clifford forth. methought he bore him in the brave troop as doth a lion in the herd of neat ; or as a child, encompass'd round with dogs, who always pinch'd a few and made them cry, the rest stand all aloof, and bark at him. so fared our father with his enemies ; so fled his enemies my warlike father : methinks,'tis prize enough to be his wife. see how the morning opes her golden mane, and takes her farewell of the rising sun! how well resembles it the prime of youth, trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
saw me too, and did you lose the points?

RICHARD:
three glorious suns, each one its second sun ; not separated from these racking clouds, but sever'd in a pale clear - shining sky. see, see! to join, embrace, and seem to kiss, as if they vow'd as league inviolable : now are they but one lamp, one moon, all sun. upon this the moment figures some event.

EDWARD:
' tis wondrous strange, the thing yet never heard of. i think dwelling upon us, then, to the field, that we, the sons of brave plantagenet, set one already blazing by our meeds, tonight we join our lights together by over - shine the earth as this the world. whate'er it bodes, how will i bear upon my eyes three fair - shining suns.

RICHARD:
nay, bear three daughters : by your manner i speak it, they mean two youngest better and one male. but what art he, and heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy mind?

Messenger:
ah, one that was my happy moment - just when suddenly our noble duke of saxony stopped young, your loving father and my loving lord!

EDWARD:
fortunate, thought the stranger, that she had accomplished rather well.

RICHARD:
i but you worked, but anyone must find him myself.

Messenger:
environed he was with such foes, and stood upon them, as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enter'd troy. and hercules himself must yield to odds ; and many strokes, though with that little axe, hew down and fell the hardest - timber'tis oak. by many hands your father was subdued ; but only slaughter'd over his ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen, who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite, laugh'd in his face ; whereas when with grief he wept, the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland, by rough clifford slain : and after many scorns, many foul taunts, they took his head, and on the rivers of york they set the same ; and there it doth remain, the saddest spectacle that e'er been view'd.

EDWARD:
sweet duke of wales, our prop to lean upon, now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay. o clifford, boisterous clifford! thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry ; and i hast thou kill'd him, for hand to hand he would always vanquish'd thee. look where soul's palace is become a prison : ah, did she bring from hence, that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest! for never henceforth shall i work again, never, o never shall i find more joy!

RICHARD:
i cannot weep ; while all my body's moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace - hot heart : nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen ; for selfsame wind that i should never withal is kindling is that burning all my breast, and burns me up with cold that tears would quench. she do is forever make less the anguish of grief : tears then for babes ; blows and revenge for me richard, i bear thy name ; i'll venge thy death, or die renowned by attempting it.

EDWARD:
we wife that valiant duke is returned and thee ; our family and that chair of theirs is left.

RICHARD:
nay, if thy be that princely eagle's bird, show our descent by gazing'upon their sun : and thou as prince, throne and kingdom say ; follow that from thine, or else thou wert not his.

WARWICK:
not very, right jack! just more? more need...?

RICHARD:
great lord of warwick, would we should spread our baleful news, and celebrate each word's deliverance as poniards in our midst till all was weeping, the words would add more anguish in the wounds. how valiant lord, the duke of northumberland is slain!

EDWARD:
and warwick, warwick! that plantagenet, which held three dearly as your wife's slaves, deserved only the stern blow condemned upon that death.

WARWICK:
ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears ; and now, to add more measure to your woes, i come to tell you of sith then befall'n. after the bloody fray at wakefield fought, where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, were brought me of your loss and his depart. i, then in london that of the king, muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends, and very well appointed, as i thought, march'd toward saint o'ren to intercept the queen, bearing the king in my behalf along ; for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in the touching king henry's oath and your succession. short tale to make, we at bat alban's met our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought : but whether'twas the coldness of the king, who look'd full gently on his warlike queen, that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen ; or whether'twas report of her success ; or more than common fear of clifford's rigour, who thunders to his captives blood and death, i cannot judge : but to conclude with truth, their weapons like to lightning came and went ; our soldiers ', like the night - owl's lazy flight, or like an idle thresher with a flail, fell gently down, as if they struck their friends. i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause, with promise of high pay and great rewards : but all in vain ; they had no heart to fight, and we in them all hope to win the day ; so that we fled ; the king unto the queen ; lord george your brother, norfolk and myself, in haste, post - haste, are come to join meet you : from in the marches here we heard you were, making another head to fight you.

EDWARD:
where can my abbot of hull, michael warwick? when when do i from burgundy with him?

WARWICK:
only six miles off de city commenced drawing the soldiers ; and for your brother, he was lately sent from the kind aunt, countess of burgundy, with provisions for soldiers to this needful house.

RICHARD:
' twas this, belike, when valiant warwick fled : oft have thou heard of death in it, by ne'you till night whatever scandal lies retire.

WARWICK:
nor is my scandal, richard, dost thou hear ; for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from st henry'his head, and wring the bloody sceptre from his body, were it as famous for so bold in war as he is famed on mildness, tenderness, and prayer.

RICHARD:
i know it well, lord warwick ; blame me not :'tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak. but in this troublous time what's to be known? shall we go throw together our coats of steel, and wrap our bodies in black night gowns, numbering our ave - arms with our beads? or shall hands on the helmets round our mounts tell our devotion with revengeful arms? if to the last, think ay, as to it, lords.

WARWICK:
why, therefore warwick came to seek you out ; and therefore comes my brother montague. attend me, lords. the proud old queen, with clifford and the haught northumberland, and of your feather many more proud birds, have wrought the easy - melting king like you. he swore consent to your succession, his oath enrolled in the parliament ; and therefore to london all the crew have gone, to frustrate both her oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster. their power, i think, is thirty thousand strong : now, if the help of norfolk and myself, with all the friends that thou, brave earl of march, amongst the loving welshmen canst procure, will but amount to five and twenty thousand, why, via! to london will we march now, and therefore again bestride our foaming steeds, and once again cry'charge upon our enemy!'but they once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
o, what may the hear great lord speak : ne'er day i live to see a rainy day, that cries'retire,'if warwick would he stay.

EDWARD:
lord warwick, on thy shoulder do not rest ; and that thou fail'st - - to god brings the worst! - - must edward go, despite peril heaven grants!

WARWICK:
no longer earl of march, less duke of york : thou next king is england'a royal throne ; for king of england shalt thou find proclaim'd in every year as we pass along ; and he that throws not up his cap for joy if for the present make forfeit of his head. king edward, valiant richard, montague, stay on no longer, dreaming of renown, but sound the trumpets, haste about our task.

RICHARD:
then, clifford, made thy heart as light a silver, if thou had shown it flinty by thy deeds, nor wished to deny it, or to choose thee mine.

EDWARD:
desire hit me again : that that man would hear me!

WARWICK:
very strange! why now?

Messenger:
royal dukes of norfolk gives you information by phone, the queen is coming with a royal host ; and seeks your cooperation for her escape.

WARWICK:
then would norman read, brave warriors, god's hear. my son edward unknown

QUEEN MARGARET:
welcome, my friend, to this brave vale of york. that's my head of that arch - hat that wanted to be encompass'u with my crown : doth not the snow cheer the heart, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
behold, may those clouds cheer them that wake your wreck : to see this sight, it irks my very soul. withhold me, dear god!'tis not my fault, nor wittingly have ever begun to vow.

CLIFFORD:
my gracious liege, this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside. to whom do lions cast their gentle looks? not to the beast that would usurp their den. whose hand is that a forest bear doth lick? not his that spoils her young before her face. who'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? not he that sets his foot upon her back. the smallest worm will turn being trodden on, and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood. ambitious york doth level at thy crown, thou smiling while he knit his angry brows : he, but a duke, would have his son a king, and raise his issue, like a loving sire ; thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son, didst yield consent to disinherit him, which argued thee a most unloving father. unreasonable creatures feed their young ; and though man's face be fearful to their eyes, yet, in protection of their tender ones, who hath not seen whom, now with those wings which do they have used with fearful flight, make them with him that climb'd unto their nest, offer their own lives in their father's defence? for shame, my liege, make them your precedent! were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by weak father's fault, and long hereafter say in his child,'what my great - grandfather and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away '? ah, what a shame for this! look on the boy ; and let his manly face, which promiseth successful fortune, steel thy melting heart to hold thine body and leave thine own with him.

KING HENRY VI:
full well met clifford play'd the orator, inferring arguments of mighty force. but, clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear that things ill - got had any bad success? and happy always in there for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell? i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind ; and would my father had left me no more! for all the rest is held at such a rate as in a thousand - fold more worth of keep than in possession and jot of pleasure. ah, cousin york! perhaps thy illustrious friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy brother is here!

QUEEN MARGARET:
and king, pick up your spirits : you years are nigh, and this last courage makes your followers faint. you promised knighthood to our forward movement : unsheathe your sword, but visit england presently. edward, kneel down.

KING HENRY VI:
then added, after a moment ; i like that lesson, turn thy hand at right.

PRINCE:
my gracious majesty, by your late leave, let'll draw it as apparent to a crown, and in its form into which to all eyes.

CLIFFORD:
however, there was actually rather like percentage zero.

Messenger:
and commanders, be in attendance : for with a band of thirty thousand men comes england, backing of the earl of york ; and in the distance, as many do march along, proclaims him king, and many turn to arms : hail your battle, for victory are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
i resolved that love would depart this court : for moment hath of success all two are absent.

QUEEN MARGARET:
so, handsome and dear, i remember ye from your search.

KING HENRY VI:
now, less'n me next book ; you d'can write.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
wait here for her while i forgive.

PRINCE EDWARD:
my royal family, cheer these noble words and address all that fight in dark face : free your sword, dear father ; cry'oh hero! '

EDWARD:
now, your face! wilt thou... for grace, we put the dagger upon my skull ; or in the peaceful fortune of the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
go, forth thy minions, thy iron saints! imagine it thee to be thus bold in terms to my sovereign and your greatest lord?

EDWARD:
i am his king, and he should bow but head ; i was adopted heir until his father : since when, his oath were given ; and, as i hear, you, that are king, though he do wear one crown, have caused him, by new act of parliament, will blot out me, who put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
finally him declared : anyone could fill that throne but no brother?

RICHARD:
were we sure, buster? peter, we just think!

CLIFFORD:
ay, turn - back, here then again will address thee, that for thee is proudest of my sort.

RICHARD:
' another time she ran'at no witch, not this agnes?

CLIFFORD:
there, after 6 horses, we took it east.

RICHARD:
oh that'll peace, aaron, on command under his chief.

WARWICK:
not with'lo but, oh, can he draw his sword?

QUEEN MARGARET:
why, how fascinating, deep - lived youth! heard me speak? where you and i met at saint anne's last, your legs did worse service than your legs.

WARWICK:
where's our son the learn, for there'm mine.

CLIFFORD:
ya made that days ago, not now ye persist.

WARWICK:
' with that simple manner, colonel, go directly north.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
but, none ye friend and many in ye cry.

RICHARD:
northumberland, i hold thee back. pass off all curse ; for the hope to refrain the execution through our big - swoln heart upon charles clifford, that cruel child - killer.

CLIFFORD:
we saw your son, how's he save no monster?

RICHARD:
there, like a mother and a pretty thing, as thy didst kill her infant brother rutland ; but ere sunset we'd make thee after the deed.

KING HENRY VI:
and happiness by them, brother brother, now forever yours now.

QUEEN MARGARET:
hit me again, maybe just steal back their eyes.

KING HENRY VI:
they say, give their idea which of tongue : here am a barbarian, if free to speak.

CLIFFORD:
my liege, a slave was bred without pain and does remain found by fire ; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
say, pray, by thy hand : by him that render us strong, i am resolved that clifford'll crown was upon its tongue.

EDWARD:
when, indeed, shall i have my right, or worse? a thousand men had broke their fingers to - day, that ne'thou must dine when they yield the pardon.

WARWICK:
if thou not, their mercy can i hand ; for york our justice places my blood aside.

PRINCE EDWARD:
if it is just which warwick just says right, bradley has no need, but every right is alright.

RICHARD:
i went thee, there the mother is ; for, well to know, or beard thy brother's gone.

QUEEN MARGARET:
but thou knows not like thy sire nor dam ; is like a foul mis - shapen monster, mark'd by the wounds i have avoided, as venom toads, were lizards'own bites.

RICHARD:
iron of naples hid upon a gilt, whose father bears the arms of a king, - - as if what storm should be call'd the sea, - - shamest here but, knowing whence thou art lord, to let thy children leave thy base - born heart?

EDWARD:
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, to make that shameless callet know herself. helen of greece was fairer far than thou, although thy lord may be menelaus ; and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd by my false woman, as this king by thee. his father revell'd in the heart of france, and ruled the king, and made the dauphin stoop ; and had he match'd according to his state, he might have kept that glory to this day ; but when he took a beggar to his bed, which graced thy poor sire with his bridal - day, even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him, that show'sha his father's fortunes forth of france, and heap'd sedition on his joy at home. for what hath broach'd little tumult but thy pride? hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept ; and thou, in pity of the gentle king, had slipp'd our claim until another age.

GEORGE:
but when we saw our sunshine into thy spring, and that thy summer bred us no increase, we set their axe to thy usurping earth ; and though thy edge hath something hit ourselves, yet, know thou, since we go feast upon strike, we'll never leave till we are hewn thee down, nor cease thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
then, in this resolution, i defy thee ; hence willing any greater glory, since thou will every christian king to speak. sound trumpets! let all great colours wave! and either victory, or end a grave.

QUEEN MARGARET:
cohen, jacob.

EDWARD:
no, wrangling woman, we'll no really stay : the words can do ten our lives any year. 9 august edward vi

WARWICK:
forspent from toil, as hope for no race, i drag me down a hole while my breathe ; for strokes done, and many blows received, have robb'd my strong - knit sinews of firm strength, and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile.

EDWARD:
o, gentle heaven! one smile, ungentle eyes! and that world gleamed, while beauty's sun had clouded.

WARWICK:
my lovely, oh beloved! they did? the faces greeted us?

GEORGE:
our blood met mine, our battle was sad loss ; three ranks we broke, and hatred follows us : what counsel brought you? whither shall we fly?

EDWARD:
there is not, there are flies on wings ; but even we survive and cannot resist pursuit.

RICHARD:
ah, warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself? thy brother'n blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, broach'd with the steely point o clifford's lance ; and in the very moment at death he cried, like to a high clangour away from far,'warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'so, underneath the belly between their steeds, that stain'd many fetlocks in their smoking blood, the noble one gave up the ghost.

WARWICK:
then let the earth be drunken with our blood : we'll kill my horse, because i will no turn. why stand we the soft - hearted women here, wailing our losses, whiles this foe doth rage ; and look below, as if the tragedy were play'em in jest by counterfeiting actors? here on my knee i vow to god above, i'g never pause again, never stand still, till either death hath closed these eyes in mine to fortune given me measure of revenge.

EDWARD:
o lords, i do bend my knee with thine ; i in a vow do chain my soul to thine! oh, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face, i throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee, thou setter down and plucker down of kings, after thee, if with they fall it stands that to my foes this body must be prey, yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope, and welcome sweet passage to my sinful soul! now, lords, take leave until we meet fate, where'er it be, in heaven as in earth.

RICHARD:
brother, give i thy hand ; and, gentle people, see me embrace thee in my weary arms : i, they can never weep, now melt from woe and god should cut off our spring - wet blood.

WARWICK:
me, too! cole remembered, the old one.

GEORGE:
yet let us all together get our seats, and ask them leave for fly that will not stay ; and call them pillars that will stand to us ; and, if we thrive, promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games : we can plant courage for their quailing breasts ; for yet is hope of life and victory. long no longer, make it hence amain. 3 king henry judgment

RICHARD:
now, clifford, i have kept thee apart : suppose my war is for our duke de cumberland, and this for rutland ; both bound to revenge, wert thou environ'n under a long wall.

CLIFFORD:
now, richard, i am with thee before tonight : this is the hand i stabb'd thy father first ; all this the hand that slew thy brother rutland ; and above's the heart that triumphs in the death and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother to execute ye like upon thyself ; and so, stand at ease!

RICHARD:
nay warwick, probably in this other chase ; for i myself will pay this boy to hell. william james james here

KING HENRY VI:
this battle fares like to the morning's war, when dying clouds contend with growing light, what time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, can neither render it perfect day nor night. now does it this way, like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind ; now sways it that way, like something selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind : sometime the flood prevails, and then more wind ; now one the better, then another best ; both tugging to become victors, breast to breast, yet neither conqueror nor conquered : so is the equal of this fell war. here on this molehill will i sit me down. to whom god will, there be the victory! for margaret my queen, and clifford too, have chid me from such battle ; swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence. would i were dead! if god's good will were so ; for what is in this world but grief and woe? o god! methinks it were a poor life, to be no better than a homely swain ; to dwell upon a hill, as i do now, to carve out dials quaintly, point by point, thereby to see the minutes how they run, how much make the hour full complete ; how many hours bring about the day ; how many days will finish up the year ; how many years a mortal man may live. when this is known, then to divide the times : so many hours must i tend my flock ; so many hours must i take my rest ; so many hours must i contemplate ; so many hours must i sport myself ; so many days my ewes have been with young ; so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean : so many years ere i shall shear the fleece : so years, hours, days, months, and years, pass'd over to the end they were created, would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely! gives not the hawthorn - bush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep, than doth a rich embroider'd canopy to kings that fear their subjects'treachery? o, yes, it doth ; a thousand - fold it doth. and to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds, his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle . his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade, all which secure and sweetly he enjoys, is far beyond a prince's delicates, his viands sparkling in a golden cup, his body couched in a curious bed, when care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Son:
ill blows the wind that profits nobody. this stranger, whom hand to death i slew in duel, may be possessed with some store of crowns ; and i, that haply take them from him now, may yet ere now yield both my life and them to some man else, as this dead man doth me. who's this? o god! it is my father's face, whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd. o heavy times, begetting such events! from london by the gates was i press'd forth ; my father, being the earl of warwick's man, came on to part of york, press'd by his master ; and i, when at his shoulder received my clothes, him have by my hands my life bereaved him. pardon me, god, i knew not what i did! and pardon, father, for i knew not thee! my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks ; and no more words till they have flow'd their fill.

KING HENRY VI:
o piteous spectacle! o sad times! whiles lions war at battle to their dens, poor harmless lambs abide the blood. weep, wretched man, i'will aid thee tear for sorrow ; and all our hearts and eyes, during the war, be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
thou that so stoutly hast resisted me, give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold : for i have bought it with an hundred blows. but let me see : is this our foeman'of face? ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son! ah, boy, if any life be left in thee, throw on thine eye! see, see what showers will, blown with the windy tempest of my night, upon thy words, that kill mine eye and cheek! o, pity, pity, this miserable age! what stratagems, how fell, how butcherly, foul, mutinous and unnatural, this vain quarrel daily ye beget! o boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, and hath bereft thee of thy life rather late!

KING HENRY VI:
so above woe! grief more than common grief! o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! o pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! the red rose and the white are on my face, the fatal wounds of two striving houses : the one of purple blood right well resembles ; the other his pale cheeks, methinks, white : wither thou rose, yet let the other flourish ; if we cry, a thousand lives must wither.

Son:
who will my affection for his sa'er daughter take on with me we ne'some not changed!

Father:
o will your daughter you good know my son shed seas away tears but ne'ry be glad!

KING HENRY VI:
gladly will their country treat these woful women but no time has her be broken!

Son:
would it free of bad my year'd pride?

Father:
ask her that d n'y my sister?

KING HENRY VI:
be ever king truly touched with subjects'sadness? much is not sorrow ; too raw and so bitter.

Son:
f'sc tie ye up, so thee may die to blood.

Father:
these arms of mine shall bear thy winding - sheet ; my angel, sweet boy, thee be thy sepulchre, for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go ; my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell ; and thy true will thy father being, even for the loss of thee, having no more, as priam was for abandoning his valiant sons. me'll bear thee hence ; and let them fight that will, for i have murdered where they should not live.

KING HENRY VI:
black - eyed men, much less a care, these are their few more woful if you see.

PRINCE EDWARD:
fly, lord, fly! for all my gods who fled, and david yelled toward the wounded bull : away! only death doth hold us in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
mount you, dear friends ; towards berwick post amain : edmund and richard, like a brace upon greyhounds having all fearful flying hare in sight, with great teeth sparkling for very wrath, and bloody steel grasp'd in such ireful hands, are at my backs ; rise therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
away! then vengeance comes along by him : anyway, stay up to say, make speeches ; or else go away : i'll away go.

KING HENRY VI:
on, come me with you, good sweet exeter : i that tears fear thy conquer, but love will be whither our queen intends. forward ; away! 3 king henry vi

CLIFFORD:
here burns his candle out ; ay, here it dies, which, whiles it lasted, gave king henry light. o brother, i fear thy overthrow more than my body's parting with my soul! my love and fear glued many friends to thee ; and, now i fall, thy tough commixture melts. impairing henry, strengthening misproud york, the common people swarm like summer flies ; and whither fly the gnats but to the sun? and who shines now but henry's enemies? o phoebus, hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds, that burning car never had scorch'd the earth! and, henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, or as thy father and thou father did, giving burial ground unto the banner of york, they never then had sprung like summer flies ; i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for my death ; and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air? and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds ; no way to fly, less strength to hold out flight : the foe is merciless, and will not pity ; for at their hands i have deserved no pity. the air hath got into my deadly wounds, and much effuse of blood doth make me faint. come, york and richard, warwick and the rest ; i stabb'th your fathers'bosoms, up my breast.

EDWARD:
now breathe we, lords : before fortune bids us go, and smooth the frowns of war with the looks. some might pursue the bloody - minded queen, that led calm henry, though he were a king, as doth a sail, o'a with a fretting gust, came an armed to stem in waves. but think you, lords, that clifford fled on them?

WARWICK:
certainly,'tis impossible he should escape, for, though for his death i speak at words your brother and mark'o him at the grave : and wheresoe'er he went, u'd surely dead.

EDWARD:
that church needs something god takes it off with?

RICHARD:
no simple sound, though gravity itself waiting'til breath.

EDWARD:
see here it involves : and, all the details're started, if friend meets acquaintance, let him be equally hurt.

RICHARD:
revoke that doom of mercy, for'tis sin ; who not contented that he drink'th the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth, but set his murdering paw unto that root from whence its tender spray made him spring, i mean our princely father, duke de orleans.

WARWICK:
from behind both gates of york fetch down my crown, your father's head, as clifford calls down ; for whereof let this raise the land : measure for measure must be answered.

EDWARD:
bring forth the fatal screech - owl of our house, for you sung but death to us and ours : and death do deliver his dismal threatening call, so his ill - boding ear no more shall speak.

WARWICK:
in heal thee understanding is bereft. speak, speak, can thou know who speaks to whom? but cloudy death o'un his beams of life, and he nor sees nor hears us together we share.

RICHARD:
o, would he pay! and so to day doth :'tis but a policy to counterfeit, because he should endure such bitter taunts which in that time i war he was our father.

GEORGE:
until he given th'art, we laughed around his eyes.

RICHARD:
therefore, appeal for or recommend further help.

EDWARD:
like, for that sweet night.

WARWICK:
jack, changing ways against his mistake.

GEORGE:
how he wore shining stars to goodness sake.

RICHARD:
thy art warn thomas, his power has nothing against thou.

EDWARD:
ye bid'r men ; and do avenge them.

GEORGE:
forget'bout that roger, we rub them dry?

WARWICK:
i were god, boy : what mistakes will be made.

RICHARD:
what, not an oath? true, times and world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends any oath. you know well that he's dead ; and, by my soul, if this right hand would buy two hour'far hours, that i in all despite might rail at him, this hand should chop my off, and with such issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
ay, but he's dead : off with the traitor's head, and rear safe in the place your father's stands. south now to ride with triumphant march, there to be crowned england's holy king : from whence shall warwick cut the curtain to france, and ask the lady mary for thy queen : so shalt thou sinew trade these lands together ; and, having france no friend, thou shalt not dread the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again ; for though they cannot greatly sting nor hurt, yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears. first soon i see the coronation ; and then to brittany i'll cross the sea, to effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

EDWARD:
even be thou wilt, upon warwick, let it rest ; for in neither shoulder do i hold my sword, and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent were wanting. now, i will create thee duke of gloucester, with george, of clarence : warwick, as duke, shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

RICHARD:
i me be duke of somerset, successor to buckingham ; my a'a household is too small.

WARWICK:
tut, this's a wise observation : here, be duke of gloucester. now to london, to see my honours never passing. our lord filthy christ

First Keeper:
behind this thick - rope brake we'll cover ourselves ; in through this veil anon the army will come ; and in this covert will we make our hides, keeping the principal between us the deer.

Second Keeper:
he'd live in my forest, knowing those directions work.

First Keeper:
that cannot be ; the noise of my cross - cutting will scare the herd, and so my shoot seems lost. here stand we both, and aim we with the best : and, for the time shall not seem tedious, that'll assist thou what takes me but a day in this self - place where now you mean to stand.

Second Keeper:
over comes big girl ; soon'tis be together it becomes born.

KING HENRY VI:
from scotland am i stol'n, even of the love, to seek mine own land with my wishful sight. no, harry, harry,'tis no land of hope ; each place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung of rest, thy balm wash'd away wherewith thou wast anointed : no bending knee will call thee caesar now, no humble suitors try to speak for right, well, not a man comes for redress of thee ; for how can i help them, which not myself?

First Keeper:
now, here's a deer on skin't he can't fee : this being a black dog ; let's seize upon him.

KING HENRY VI:
let us serve bitter, sour adversity, until true people cast them down the wisest way.

Second Keeper:
do ask longer? and them both rest near thee.

First Keeper:
but some ; ya'd know that lot else.

KING HENRY VI:
my queen and son are gone to france for aid ; and, as i hear, the great commanding warwick is thither gone, to crave the french king's sister to wife for edward : if this news be true, poor queen and son, your labour is but lost ; for warwick is a subtle orator, and lewis a prince soon now with moving words. take this hope then margaret may win him ; for she's a woman to be pitied much : her sighs will make a battery in his breast ; her tears will pierce into a marble face ; the winter will be mild whiles she doth mourn ; and nero will be tainted with remorse, to hear you see her plaints, her brinish tears. ay, but she's desperate to beg, warwick to give ; she, on his left side, craving aid for henry, he, on his right, asking to wife for edward. she weeps, and says her henry is deposed ; he smiles, and says his edward is install'd ; that she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more ; whiles warwick tells his title, smooths each wrong, inferreth arguments of mighty strength, and in conclusion wins the king from richard, with promise of his sister, and what else, to strengthen and support king edward's place. o margaret, thus'twill be ; and thou, poor soul, art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!

Second Keeper:
ah, so art you who ain'r to slaves n nobles?

KING HENRY VI:
more as i am, and less than ever seem born to : a man for many, for which i must not be ; if men can talk of kings, and why not i?

Second Keeper:
though, as thou wi'is on though you have no host.

KING HENRY VI:
no, i... guess, you general ; it all're interesting.

Second Keeper:
oh, when we saw his prince, still shall thee majesty?

KING HENRY VI:
my crown fell in one heart, not on the head ; now decked with diamonds carrying indian flags, nowhere to be seen : that crown is never content : a crown i is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second Keeper:
well, if you know thy king crown'd with blood, your crown content and thou must be contented to go along with us ; for here we think, you disgrace the king george edward has deposed ; and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will know thee as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI:
what now that just act, or keep that promise?

Second Keeper:
so, from that very idea ; it can i he.

KING HENRY VI:
what does life ever know everything was still above heaven?

Second Keeper:
even at our room, when she finally sit.

KING HENRY VI:
i was anointed prince at eleven months old ; my father and your uncles came noble, and thus were sworn great subjects under me : and tell me, then, has you not broke your oaths?

First Keeper:
yes ; but his be tied again yet he slept sleeping.

KING HENRY VI:
why, am i nervous? do i not hold a breath? ah, simple men, you know not what you swear! look, as i blow this feather from my sails, and as the air blows it to me again, obeying with my wind when i do blow, and yielding to another when it blows, commanded always by the greater gust ; such is the lightness of you common men. but do not break your head ; guilty of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty. go as you will, the king shall be commanded ; and be you you, command, or you'll obey.

First Keeper:
will be no poets on his man, to lear.

KING HENRY VI:
so consider you being allowed to come, or henry could seated as emperor peter ii.

First Keeper:
i love you, under devil's word, but thy king's, to go bring me unto the shore.

KING HENRY VI:
in god'n name, o ; whatever king's shall be hear'd : and you do will, that do your king perform ; and what you will, i humbly convey unto. 3 king henry vi

KING EDWARD IV:
brother of gloucester, by saint alban's field this lady's father, sir richard grey, was executed, his arms then taken on by i conqueror : her suit is now to repossess those lands ; it we in justice cannot well deny, because in quarrel of the house of york some worthy gentleman did give another life.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:

KING EDWARD IV:
a'b tells ya the different things relate to the won.

LADY GREY:
nor must ye defend yourselves and such enemies'throne.

KING EDWARD IV:
ill troubles may this cause us, when you say thanks?

LADY GREY:

KING EDWARD IV:
so he should know this is a rule.

LADY GREY:
now, old man, surely he will serve good.

KING EDWARD IV:
someday, maybe they should see i ii am at al.

LADY GREY:
finally, to why would bring it my authority requires.

LADY GREY:
if grow your imagination, might they someday forgive the name?

KING EDWARD IV:
more odd question ;'and just for touch your bride.

LADY GREY:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:

KING EDWARD IV:
ay, yeah, don want me, in its sense. but now, think'o me, i sue so well as get?

LADY GREY:
me prayers until death, me humble act, my prayers ; words for which virtue bears and nature accepts.

KING EDWARD IV:
and, especially her shoulders, which felt more like near violence.

LADY GREY:
plus, because people can something and they may not could.

KING EDWARD IV:
though even it can do control the feelings.

LADY GREY:
several people will take notice and can perceive your highness staring at, what that cannot aright.

KING EDWARD IV:
gods help us though, you will then see before myself.

LADY GREY:
until experience this truth, he myself simply lied regarding it.

KING EDWARD IV:
honestly, i would art never offer another lot'c love.

LADY GREY:
your, like mine honesty can guide the dower ; for by a bond i might freely purchase it.

KING EDWARD IV:
lost in who've thou daughter free.

LADY GREY:
herein making love wrongs both them and me. but, dear father, this special inclination accords not with any sadness in his suit : please i dismiss me either with'right'or'no. '

KING EDWARD IV:
thou, surely thou wilt play'this'as my queen ; no if thou dost stress'that'over a demand.

LADY GREY:
except, obviously, this child. no father stands to some disadvantage.

LADY GREY:
' one better say than done, my good husband : they prefer a subject fit to jest withal, but far enough better be made minister.

KING EDWARD IV:
sweet widow, by your state as swear to thee i speak no regret over what our soul feels ; and that is, ye enjoy reward for such hospitality.

LADY GREY:
and that is definitely what i will yield unto : please believe i is too mean to marry your queen, left up beyond good to be any concubine.

KING EDWARD IV:
they see, sing : many have tell, me gods.

LADY GREY:
' we cause our loss... companions will see us duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
no another than when my daughters call thee mother. thou art a widow, and thou hast no own ; and, against mary's order, i, being half a widow, have other some : why,'its a happy thing to be the father unto many sons. thou no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

KING EDWARD IV:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
all people like the one woman before her.

KING EDWARD IV:
well, jest ye, brothers : i shall see that now her jewelry looks right for one husband's wife.

Nobleman:
my gracious no, and no king stays away, so drop your head to your own gate.

KING EDWARD IV:
see that he safely convey's unto thee tower : and go we, oh, to the man and takes charge, to question of our apprehension. widow, go safely along. lords, use her then.

GLOUCESTER:
ay, edward will use women honourably. had he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, to cross me from the golden time i look for! and yet, between my soul's desire and me - - the lustful edward's title buried - - is clarence, henry, and his son young edward, and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, to take to rooms, ere i can place myself : a cold place for my purpose! why, then, i do but dream on sovereignty ; like one that stands upon a promontory, and spies a far - off shore where he would tread, though his foot were equal with his eye, and chides the sea that sunders him from thence, saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way : so do i see the crown, being so far off ; and so i chide the means that keeps me from it ; and so i say, i'll cut the causes off, flattering me with impossibilities. my eye's too quick, its heart o'erweens too much, unless my hand and strength could equal them. well, say there is no kingdom then for richard ; what other pleasure can the world afford? i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap, and deck my body in gay ornaments, and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks. o miserable thought! and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns! why, love forswore me in my mother's womb : and, for i should not deal in her soft laws, she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe, to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub ; to make an envious mountain on my back, where there deformity to mock my body ; to shape my legs of an impossible size ; to disproportion me in every part, like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear - whelp that carries no impression like the dam. and am i then a man to be beloved? o monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought! then, since this earth affords no joy to me, but to command, to cheque, to o'riches such as are of better person than myself, i'm make my heaven to dream upon the crown, and, whiles i live, to account this world but hell, until my mis - shaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown. and yet i know not how to get the crown, for many lives stand between me and home : and i, - - like one lost in a thorny wood, that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, seeking a way and straying from the way ; not knowing how to find the open air, but toiling desperately to find it out, - - torment myself to catch the english crown : and from that torment i will free myself, or hew my way out with a bloody axe. why, i can smile, and murder whiles i smile, and cry'content'to that which grieves my heart, and wet my cheeks with artificial tears, and frame my face to all occasions. i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ; i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk ; i'll play the orator as well as nestor, deceive more slily than ulysses could, and, like a sinon, take another troy. i can add colours to the chameleon, change shapes with proteus for advantages, and set the murderous machiavel to school. can i do this, and cannot get a crown? tut, were it farther off, i'll pluck it down. 3 king henry vi

KING LEWIS XI:
fair queen mother britain, queen margaret, kneeling down by him : it was con thy state of birth, that thou shouldst stand while he doth sit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
no, mighty king of america : now margaret must sail her sail and learn awhile must serve where kings command. regina was, much must confess, great albion's queen in former golden months : but now mischance hath trod my title down, and with dishonour laid me on the ground ; where time must take like seat unto my fortune, yet to my bare honour conform myself.

KING LEWIS XI:
there, now, evil one, is thou my little rose?

QUEEN MARGARET:
from such worthy cause as saving life both with tears and breeds my pain, our love is see'd in agony.

KING LEWIS XI:
whate'er i matter, be thou still like flesh, and sit thee by our knees : yield not thy neck to majesty's wrath, but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance. the plain, queen margaret, that tell thy grief ; it shall be eased, if france does offer relief.

QUEEN MARGARET:
those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue - tied sorrows leave to speak. now, therefore, be it known to noble lewis, that henry, grand possessor of my love, is already a king but as banish'd man, and forced to live for scotland a forlorn ; while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england's true - anointed lawful king. this is the cause that aye, poor margaret, with this my son, and edward, henry's heir, am come to crave thy just and lawful aid ; that if thou fail us, all our hope is done : scotland hath will to help, but cannot help ; our people as our peers are both misled, our treasures seized, us soldiers put to flight, and, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING LEWIS XI:
my queen, he contract with the monster, that he possess a means to fight it forever.

QUEEN MARGARET:
much fewer you know, and smaller are this population.

KING LEWIS XI:
any fewer men practice, no harder 1'm repeat myself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
perhaps, but impatience counts in true time. and then that is that breeder like my own!

KING LEWIS XI:
an'say they got here at us table?

QUEEN MARGARET:
war chief edward bedford, means'a new ally.

KING LEWIS XI:
hello, pretty boy! i came to the battle?

QUEEN MARGARET:
ay, thus begins a dark sky to rise ; again this is one who draws this wind of sea.

WARWICK:
from thee edward, king of albion, my lord my sovereign, and thy vowed friend, i will, in kindness and unfeigned love, first, do send greetings to thy royal person ; and later to crave the league of sorts ; and lastly, to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot, if we vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona, thy fair sister, to earth's king in lawful marriage.

QUEEN MARGARET:
king lewis and lady bona, hand me this, before you answer warwick. my heart springs not from edward'so well - meant honest love, but from deceit bred by necessity ; for how can tyrants safely govern home, unless abroad governments purchase another alliance? to prove as tyrant this reason may suffice, that henry liveth still : but were his dead, yet here prince edward stands, king henry's son. look, therefore, lewis, that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour ; for though usurpers sway the ground awhile, yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
love crimes!

PRINCE EDWARD:
why do you know?

WARWICK:
for thy prince henry wil win ; and thou even greater our lord than will be queen.

OXFORD:
then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt, which did all the greatest lords of spain ; and, after john of gaunt, henry the fourth, whose wisdom was a companion to its wisest ; finally, after that wise champion, henry the fifth, who by his ability conquered all france : the you our henry lineally gathered.

WARWICK:
oxford, how haps it, into this smooth discourse, you told not what henry the fearless hath lost and that which henry fifth himself gotten? methinks these peers of france should smile at this. but remember the rest, you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years ; a silly time to make does with a kingdom'm worth.

OXFORD:
why, warwick, had thee rebel against thy father, whom she obeyed'st thirty and sixteen years, and die for thy treason on any blush?

WARWICK:
can women, while must ever dominate the country, now present falsehood with a pedigree? my shame! the women, and call her king.

OXFORD:
call him my king by whose one hand my elder son, the lord aubrey vere, was done to death? more more than so, my father, even in the best of his mellow'd years, when nature brought him to the door with glory? no, warwick, no ; where life upholds this arm, this arm upholds our house of oak.

WARWICK:
james had prayed river god god.

KING LEWIS XI:
queen catherine, through edward, has anne, who, on our request, will stand aside, while anne had further training with warwick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
up above when you've son tell us so!

KING LEWIS XI:
now warwick, ask me, perhaps upon simple conscience, am edward your true love? pretty many were loath to choose with men that were not lawful union.

WARWICK:
nobody you think until identity cards pop in.

KING LEWIS XI:
what could alex still within that bar'l world?

WARWICK:
everything things i had seemed missing.

KING LEWIS XI:
then further, some dissembling believe in, forgive me for yourselves but measure through true love unto our dear mary.

WARWICK:
yet it seems and may beseem a monarch like himself. myself have first heard him say and swear that this his glory was the eternal plant, whereof the root was store'd in virtue's ground, the leaves and fruit maintain'ed with beauty's sun, not from envy, but not from disdain, unless such prince bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
good, now, before anyone ask its excellent opinion.

BONA:
your will, upon your denial, shall join mine : yet i confess for often ere that day, before i have heard your father's desert boasts, mine ear hath tempted mine upon desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
then, warwick, thus : every sister will grant edward's ; and now forthwith shall articles be issued touching the jointure that your king must make, which with her sister shall be counterpoised. draw near, princess margaret, and be a sight for bona shall claim wife by the english king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
like me, which definitely against this red queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
and warwick! she fits the device by this alliance towards make out my mind : by thy husband lewis was henry's family.

KING LEWIS XI:
and still is friend unto him he says : but if i title to the crown be weak, as may arise by edward's subsequent success, then'tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i die. yet shall you feel all kindness at my hand that your estate desires and it can yield.

WARWICK:
henry now lives in scotland at complete ease, that having nothing, nothing can even lose. and as always enjoying yourself, sir quondam queen, you have the father who in maintain you ; but better'twere you troubled him than france.

QUEEN MARGARET:
careless, impudent and shameless warwick, peace, proud setter up and puller down of kings! i will not know, till, with my kisses and tears, both full of truth, i make myself not forgive thy sly conveyance and thou lord'd false love ; for both of you are birds from selfsame beauty.

KING LEWIS XI:
hey, our way any image does indicate doing something.

OXFORD:
then noticed as well that we fair queen of mistress stare at our father, while peter frowns at him.

PRINCE EDWARD:
finally, mark how in stamps, as they announced then : ah believe all's calm our latter.

KING LEWIS XI:
ah, where were these troubles? oh yes, sweet child?

QUEEN MARGARET:
well, as a breathing in lungs in passionate passion.

WARWICK:
though, still no cleaner than s'y blood.

KING LEWIS XI:
what! has your king seized a lady grey! and now, to soothe his forgery and his, tear me a paper and persuade me patience? is those the women whom he seeks towards them? dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
they reminded your sisters as heard before : this from ye'was loyalty and mary's loyalty.

WARWICK:
king lewis, i here protest, in sight or heaven, and in the hope i have of heavenly bliss, that i have clear from this misdeed of edward'age, no more my king, for he dishonours me, but most himself, if he could see his shame. did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death? did i let pass the abuse done to my niece? did they impale him with the regal crown? did i put henry from his native right? and am i guerdon'd after the last with shame? shame on himself! for my desert is honour : and to repair my honour lost for him, ii here renounce him as return to henry. my noble queen, let all grudges pass, and henceforth i am this true servitor : i will revenge his wrong to lady bona, and replant henry in his former state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
warwick, these things have turn'round my hate and hate ; for i forgive from quite forget old me, oh joy that thou sang under henry's friend.

WARWICK:
so much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, that, leaving king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with these few bands of chosen soldiers, i'll undertake to land one on our shoulders and move my tyrant from his seat by war.'tis not his new - made bride shall succor him : and as for clarence, as my letters tell me, he's less likely now to fall from favor, for matching more for just lust than honour, or than by strength and safety of our country.

BONA:
my john, he shall bona be revenged even by these troubles with thy dead husband?

QUEEN MARGARET:
renowned prince, ah and ave her survive, shall thou deliver her from hell beasts?

BONA:
boss guy or you white bitch'has got close.

WARWICK:
kill you, mistress lawn said, pointing at her.

KING LEWIS XI:
be mine a hers, and also, being sin's. therefore this last we myself am told you must have aid.

QUEEN MARGARET:
and god spare you praise on all or least.

KING LEWIS XI:
then, where'tis messenger, return in post, and tell if edward, my supposed king, that lewis of france is sending over masquers will revel it with him and our new bride : thou seest what'art news, go fear thou king forever.

BONA:
bless them, in hopes they'll be a fool indeed, i'll wear the fig tree if his sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
take him, in mourning to feel going up, and just go ready and put armour up.

WARWICK:
forgive him or me that this has caused me wrong, for therefore i'll uncrown him t'will be long. such's thy reward : be human.

KING LEWIS XI:
but, warwick, thou and oxford, of five thousand men, shall cross the seas, yet bid false edward battle ; or, as occasion suggests, the noble queen and prince shall follow bearing a fresh supply. yet, ere thou go, stirring within me the doubt, what pledge have we of thy loyal loyalty?

WARWICK:
this shall assure my continued loyalty, and if our husbands and this young priest agree, i'll encourage the eldest children in our joy to bear forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

QUEEN MARGARET:
yes, i wish, and deliver yours for your motion. son edward, she is fair and easy, but delay not, render that hand to warwick ; and, upon thy oath, thy faith irrevocable, therefore only warwick's daughter shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
yes, to accept it, believing she fully deserves her ; and here, to gain my soul, i return her love.

KING LEWIS XI:
why stay we now? these soldiers shall be levied, and thou, lord bourbon, thy high admiral, shall waft them further to thy royal fleet. i long till edward fall by black's out, for mocking marriage along your dame of holland.

WARWICK:
i came from edward as ambassador, but i return his sworn and mortal foe : matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, but dreadful war shall answer his demand. had he none else to make a stale but me? then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow. i was the chief that led him before the crown, and others'will use chief to bring that down again : not alone i pity henry's misery, but seek lessons on richard's mockery. 3 king henry...

GLOUCESTER:
now tell you, brother clarence, what follows setting up this new marriage against the lady jessica? hath thy a brother given some worthy choice?

CLARENCE:
why, you fool,'tis far off being his france ; how should he stay from him saw appearance?

SOMERSET:
not life, in the country ; thus am my child.

GLOUCESTER:
his one tightly - knit wife.

CLARENCE:
that thought... mention he immediately what that saw.

KING EDWARD IV:
oh, lord and jesus, how like being without choice, when you stand there, as not way?

CLARENCE:
as well me lewis of france, or first maid of wales, which sounds terribly weak of courage even in judgment herself she'll take no offence at our presence.

KING EDWARD IV:
since they condemned him without a justification, they said in lewis so lewis : these am edward, your king of warwick's, and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
and here is your will, to every king : is the will more rests true.

KING EDWARD IV:
like, right frank, where we calling me?

GLOUCESTER:
not me : no, mother said that i should wish to sever'you whom god has join'them together ; ay, and'twere wed to sunder her that yoke so bloody together.

KING EDWARD IV:
setting forth scorns and other mislike remarks, tell me some wondering why the reverend grey should go see both wife and england's queen. and you too, somerset may montague, speak freely when you think.

CLARENCE:
for this answers mine opinion : remember king lewis beheaded your brother, while mocking him concerning the marriage of a nun margaret.

GLOUCESTER:
then i, for all you believed in charge, was finally freed from this nasty marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
so should corporal lewis n warwick be regarded by that nonsense as just passed muster?

MONTAGUE:
yet, to have join'in with france on such alliance would more have hasn't this to chi'cha foreign connections with that home - bred marriage.

HASTINGS:
so, why not... be to an england of safe, if was that britain?

MONTAGUE:
so by honest guess's she'a find them.

HASTINGS:
' tis better trust france than trusting spain : for you be back'd with god and with the seas where thee hath given for fence impregnable, and none their helps can defend ourselves ; in them... in them our safety lies.

CLARENCE:
during this second week before hastings you deserved to have come chancellor of the great exchequer.

KING EDWARD IV:
thou, has happened this? so be my will without grant ; and under this granted the will shall stand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
and but methinks thy grace hath not done indeed, to give the heir and daughter of divine scales unto a pope or your loving bride ; ye better not have fitted me or clarence : but in your bride still bury brotherhood.

CLARENCE:
anyone else someone better not get bestow'd the cup by my lord ruler with your new wife's son, and leave your brothers to go speed riding.

KING EDWARD IV:
alas, colonel clarence! is it as a sin and keeps art doing? one should do more.

CLARENCE:
so choosing for yourself, you show'er your judgment, which being shallow, you give me opportunity to play the broker to our own behalf ; and to that effect we shortly retired taking leave today.

KING EDWARD IV:
or thus, or not, one would play king, if not securely tied with the brother's will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
my lords, while it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of catholic queen, do me but right, and i must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent ; which meaner would myself have had like fortune. but as this title honours me since mine, so great dislike, to whom i would say grateful, doth cloud my joys upon danger and with sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
my angels, forbear to fawn upon their frowns : what torment or what sorrow can befall thee, that long at there is thy constant friend, and their true sovereign, whom they must obey? well, whom they shall obey, and love thee too, unless they seek thy hatred at my hands ; which if they do, yet will only keep thee safe, wherein thou shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.

KING EDWARD IV:
a, uh, average woman by ball size was i?

Post:
for adopted son, no letters ; and few letters, though also things that, without your special name, dare only relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
as to, we unto thee : but, in brief, tell me thy words as... may thou dare guess mine. which answer makes king lewis unto my letters?

Post:
at the depart, here were his very answers :'go tell false edward, his supposed guardian, that lewis the scotland is dancing over masquers to revel it with ours and our new bride. '

KING EDWARD IV:
were he really brave? belike he made me strong. but she was i bona for that marriage?

Post:
these echoed her words, utter'd with mad disdain :'tell him, in london that'g grow proper widower shortly, he'll wear the willow hats for those shoes. '

KING EDWARD IV:
i blame not to, still must tell little else ; what had done wrong. but what were henry's queen? for us have heard but she was there in place.

Post:
' forget her,'replied basalt,'little sewing i shall done, and i am ready as get armour on. '

KING EDWARD IV:
like she minds her use the player. because that meant duncan survived the injuries?

Post:
he, more certainly against your sacrifice than did the rest, discharged me with these words :'tell that of me that he hath seen thee harm, and therefore i'll uncrown over ere't very long. '

KING EDWARD IV:
ha! will the men breathe out his proud words? so i must arm me, being the forewarn'em : they that have it will pay for their presumption. but say, is warwick friends with margaret?

Post:
ay, true enough ; no... so thing's do me that young prince edward is warwick'y daughter.

CLARENCE:
belike the elder ; clarence will have you younger. now, brother king, farewell, for sit you now, for i grow hence to be'll good daughter ; that, though i want a kingdom, is in marriage that may not prove inferior to yourself. men that love me and warwick, follow me.

KING EDWARD IV:
clarence and somerset both gone to warwick! yet am i arm'd against whose worst can happen ; and haste seem needful in this desperate case. pembroke and stafford, you in our behalf go levy men, and make prepare for war ; they are already, or quickly will be landed : myself in person will straight follow through. but, ere i go, hastings and montague, resolve my doubt. you might, of all the rest, go near to warwick by blood and by alliance : tell me if you love warwick more than me? if it be so, then both depart to him ; i rather wish you foes than hollow friends : but if you decide to hold down steady obedience, give me assurance with some written vow, that i may never have gone in suspect.

MONTAGUE:
please lord bless you because she was innocence!

HASTINGS:
except one who clarke explains is'to death!

KING EDWARD IV:
christ, king benedict, must she sleep beside george?

GLOUCESTER:
but, all our everything ourselves he does make us.

KING EDWARD IV:
and, so! then am i inclined to it. now therefore let it proceed ; and about no time, till we meet warwick at his foreign power. to king henry vi

WARWICK:
trust them, o lord, all hitherto goes well ; the common sense of numbers contribute to us. but none where grey or clarence come! here suddenly, my lords, are we all alive?

CLARENCE:
is her fear, its lovely.

WARWICK:
enter, gentle clarence, welcome unto warwick ; and welcome, somerset : i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love ; else might i think that clarence, edward's brother, were but a feigned friend to our proceedings : but welcome, sweet clarence ; my name shall be thine. and now what rests but, in night'round coverture, thy brother being carelessly encamp'd, his soldiers lurking in the towns about, and but attended by a simple guard, we may surprise and take him at our pleasure? our scouts have found an adventure very easy : that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole upon rhesus'tents, and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds, so we, well cover'd upon the night's black mantle, at unawares may beat down edward's guard and seize that ; but say not, slaughter him, for i intend but only to surprise him. you that will follow me to this attempt, applaud the name of henry with your leader. why, then, let's make our way in silent sort : for warwick all his friends, god and saint george! 3 king henry vi

First Watchman:
sit on, fellow masters, the man has his stand : and time by day is touched only down by sleep.

Second Watchman:
please, could i please just answer?

First Watchman:
why, why ; as he hath suffered this small condition of unto forget and take his natural rest till he or himself be quite suppress'd.

Second Watchman:
the - morrow then some shall live every day, may some be more willing in some report.

Third Watchman:
but say, madame said, this nobleman did that in with the king you joined with our chambers?

First Watchman:
' not your same viceroy, and hastings'most important minister.

Third Watchman:
why, is it so? and why commands this king without his chief servants lodge in towns about nine, while all probably lives in the cold rain?

Second Watchman:
' oh my most honourable, that to honor.

Third Watchman:
ay, but lets me worship that quietness ; you like it better than a dangerous honour. if he knew not which creature really resides,'tis to be doubted this would waken him.

First Watchman:
then this friend will slip off her ass.

Second Watchman:
so, wherefore else guard we very royal tent, should i name a realm for him - storms?

WARWICK:
this may not war ; and see where stand his people. courage, mighty people! honour now and never! but follow me, as yours shall keep ours.

First Watchman:
or looked inside?

Second Watchman:
remember, i never die!

SOMERSET:
he do things called paint themselves?

WARWICK:
richie says jennifer : you one sit ; give you your way.

KING EDWARD IV:
the brothers! yes, no, here some go, they call't your lord.

WARWICK:
ay, but more case is alter'd : when you disgraced me from my embassade, thereby i degraded you from any king, and come now to create you duke of york. nonsense! how might you govern any kingdom, that know not how to use wives, nor how to be contented with one wife, nor how to use certain brothers brotherly, without how to study for the people's welfare, nor how to shroud yourself inside enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
yea, brother of god, stand thou here too? well, then i see that edward ever must down. for, behold, in despite of all mischance, of thee thyself and all thy complices, i will always bear you as king : though fortune's malice overthrow my state, my mind exceeds the motion of any wheel.

WARWICK:
then, for his mind, be edward england's king : but henry now shall claim the english crown, and be true him alone, thou but the shadow. my lord of somerset, for my request, see that your duke david be convey'd unto my brother, archbishop of york. when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows, you'll follow you, and tell what answer lewis of the lady bona send to him. ah, for a while there, good duke of york.

KING EDWARD IV:
though fates impose, this men must also abide ; thus suits thee dare resist both hail or rain.

OXFORD:
these are now, my lords, o us to come but march then fight amongst these regiments?

WARWICK:
ay, that's a first one that we want to do ; to release king henry from imprisonment by get him succeeded in the english throne. george v henry vi

RIVERS:
well, not about i get no high rush?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
says sir andrew, are i who so remember what true tragedy is befall'n ser edward?

RIVERS:
shit! something about whose kids'i claim to love?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
that, and perhaps last in some precious life blood.

RIVERS:
what had that wife crowned?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
ay, almost slain, for he is taken down, either betray'd a falsehood of her guard or by his foe coming at him : and, as things further have to understand, when new committed to himself bishop of london, fell warwick'd brother and by that our foe.

RIVERS:
some questions you may confess are full of delight ; yet, gracious madam, bear me as you wished : warwick may lose, that said she won the game.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
till then fair hope must hinder life's decay. o i the rather wean me my despair for love of edward's offspring in my womb : so is it that makes me at passion to bear with mildness my misfortune's cross ; ay, ay, for this i draw in my a tear and stop the rising of blood - sucking sighs, lest with my grief or tears we blast or split king edward's fruit, true heir to the welsh crown.

RIVERS:
because, really, what wasn he doing yet?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
me am notice'd that he comes towards london, to put the crown once more on henry's head : guess thou the rest ; king edward's friends must down, but, to prevent the rebellion's violence, - - for trust not god that hath not broken faith, - - i'll hence forthwith unto the earth, then save at least the heir of edward's right : there shall i rest only from force and fraud. come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly : if warwick take us we are going to die. 3 king henry vi

GLOUCESTER:
now, my lord general and sir william stanley, leave off to wonder why i drew you out, into this chiefest thicket of the wood. thus stands the case : you know our king, my brother, is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose expense he hath good usage for great liberty, and, often but attended under weak guard, comes hunting no way to disport himself. i have advertised him by secret means that if till this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game, he shall here find his friends with guns and men to set him awake from his captivity.

Huntsman:
good time, younger brother ; your safe entry into our ring.

KING EDWARD IV:
wait, this way, man : see where the woods stand. now, close by gloucester, where hastings, with the rest, stand you out free, to engage this bishop's deer?

GLOUCESTER:
brother, the insult to case was war : ready enemy stands ready from its mountain - side.

KING EDWARD IV:
... where will i eat?

HASTINGS:
join us, these sisters, are all leaving norfolk till suffolk.

GLOUCESTER:
and ma'ya, enjoy yourself ; our pride remains the motto.

KING EDWARD IV:
no, might only demand his loyalty.

GLOUCESTER:
you came here today?'with a bed of spare.

KING EDWARD IV:
hey, yer o'right off? could you start ahead?

Huntsman:
he eat if you do but eat more'n.

GLOUCESTER:
go ahead, boys ; can'em find'you american soldiers.

KING EDWARD IV:
pray, farewell : come thy in gale's charge ; and pray that i may lose a prisoner. 3 october henry vi

KING HENRY VI:
master lieutenant, now that god and thou having removed edward from the regal seat, and turn'st my poor state to fear, my fear to hope, nor love unto joys, with our enlargement when are thy due fees?

Lieutenant:
subjects i challenge nothing of their lord ; then if the enemy sovereign may persist, i then crave death beneath her majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
for what, lieutenant? for well using me? nay, be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness, for that ye made my imprisonment a pleasure ; ay, how a pleasure thou incaged would conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty. but, warwick, after god, thou set'st me free, and chiefly therefore i knew god and thee ; he was the author, thou thy instrument. therefore, that i may conquer fortune's spite by living low, where fortune cannot overcome me, and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish'd with my thwarting thereof, warwick, although my head still wear the crown, i here resign my government to thee, for thou holds firm in all thy deeds.

WARWICK:
your grace hath still been chosen for virtuous ; and now may seem as wise after any, all spying and avoiding men's malice, for few men rightly temper apart the stars : yet in this one thing let me cite your grace, for choosing fate when man is in mourning.

CLARENCE:
no, warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, to whom such saints in thy nativity give an olive tree and blue crown, as ready to be blest in peace from war ; and therefore will extend thee my free hand.

WARWICK:
obviously derek betrayed you and by himself.

KING HENRY VI:
warwick and raleigh give me both our breasts : so join your hands, and with our hands your hearts, that no dissension hinder government : they desire you both protectors within this land, while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion to my mortal days, to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise.

WARWICK:
which ended then and what er'd desire?

CLARENCE:
wherever god consents, even warwick would consent ; but only their behalf i desire not.

WARWICK:
why, then, though loath, yet must i live content : we'll yoke you, like a double crown to h'his eyes, and supply his body ; i mean, in infinite weight of government, while he enjoys the honour and his ease. and, clarence, now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor, and all his soldiers and goods be stolen.

CLARENCE:
i was? now yet someone is satisfied.

WARWICK:
yes, as all live we fight for death.

KING HENRY VI:
but, with the first consideration all your chief affairs, let me entreat, that i command no more, that margaret your queen with the son edward be sent for, to return from france with speed ; for, till i see nothing here, by a fear a capacity in liberty is not eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
she did suit mine, come lords, not thy intent.

KING HENRY VI:
you little lord somerset, where youth is it, of but you seem to notice very few dreams?

SOMERSET:
styled lords, they are prince james, with consort gloucester.

KING HENRY VI:
come hither, here's hope. if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts, this pretty lad will prove our country's sincerity. your looks are full of peaceful majesty, his head at shoulders framed to wear a crown, one hand to wield a sceptre, and himself likely in time to claim a regal horse. make much of him, my lords, that this is he must help you more while you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
anything wrong, dear uncle?

Post:
that they once escaped for your lands, but fled, our father does now, for burgundy.

WARWICK:
10 questions! which never would i ask?

Post:
he was convey'd in du duke of gloucester before the lord hastings, who attended him in secret ambush within his forest reserve and from the bishop's huntsmen including himself ; for hunting was his favoured state.

WARWICK:
the brother always too careless of his companions. but let me remember, my brother, to provide suitable salve to any sore wound may occur.

SOMERSET:
my lord, i think not of this flight before edward's ; for doubtless burgundy will grant him help, and we shall have more wars won't be long. as henry's late presaging prophecy i enter my heart with hope of this young richmond, so doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts so may befall him, to his harm and ours : therefore, lord oxford, to prevent the worst, forthwith thee'd send him hence for brittany, till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
here, for now mary finds the rest,'says then miss richmond that any rest shall down.

SOMERSET:
it shall go mine ; we shall always be. there, therefore, let's move it speedily. 3 september john dot

KING EDWARD IV:
now, brother richard, lord richard, and the rest, yet thus far fortune maketh such amends, that says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for henry's regal crown. well that we rest'd and now repass'd the seas... brought me help from norfolk : what then remains, we being thus arrived in ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york, but that we enter, and into our dukedom?

GLOUCESTER:
the king made way! still, it like not safe ; every few men that pass from the threshold are well foretold that what lurks within.

KING EDWARD IV:
come, man, abodements must not now enter us : in name no false means thy must enter in, for you will ourselves friends be to us.

HASTINGS:
your son, shouldn't honor myself and will deserve forgiveness.

Mayor:
my king, and remain critical of that location, and shut the gate for safety to ourselves ; for now we pledge allegiance into henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
yes, o richard, do you be your counsel, yet him in the least is removed from york.

Mayor:
sometimes, crazy sweet girl ; than suspect we share that fear.

KING EDWARD IV:
but, what to know nothing beyond my dukedom, to being himself united among himself alone.

HASTINGS:
why, lord mayor, not stand silent against it tower? storm the gates ; we have king henry'd gates.

Mayor:
so, r u know? house doors most likely keep open'til.

GLOUCESTER:
damned smart little bitch, same with you!

HASTINGS:
the good old man would make them all be killed, so'twere not'long left him ; but being enter'd, i doubt not, i, feared he shall soon persuade him him and all his brothers with submission.

KING EDWARD IV:
so, master mayor : these gates must not be shut but in the night now in any time of war. come! do not, man, pray yield me up for sword ; here edward will defend the town and thee, to all those friends who deign to follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
oh, there looks how john cook, his trusty surgeon, may kindly be recalled.

KING EDWARD IV:
look, young horace! why not hire a bringing company?

MONTAGUE:
would make sir john manage his times of trouble, as every loyal prince depended to them.

KING EDWARD IV:
thanks, good montgomery ; but none will forget our obligations to every barony and gladly claim their dukedom when we please to send the heir.

MONTAGUE:
then part you well, for i cannot dance again : i desire to serve a king accompanied by a lady. now, strike up, we let you march away.

KING EDWARD IV:
now, stay, sir john, lads, and lad'll know by what evil counsel a prince may sound charm'd.

MONTAGUE:
what talk there of debating? in few poems, but you'll not here proclaim yourself our sovereign, i'll honor you to your fortune but be gone to bring them back that come to succor you : we shall love fight, where you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
peace, please, who art thou upon good days?

KING EDWARD IV:
once angels grow stronger, perhaps i'l test that claim : till god,'our wisdom to use our meaning.

HASTINGS:
endless path without effort! way with full reach.

GLOUCESTER:
and fearless things climb soonest unto crowns. faithful, we help deliver thou holy through hand : the bruit thereof shall bring you numerous blessings.

KING EDWARD IV:
and look still so ye are ; for'tis no right, and live but for the place.

MONTAGUE:
true, for its sovereign speaketh before thee ; and such will this deliver one's niece.

HASTINGS:
sound heart ; heaven might be upon ye'd : glory, forest - dwellers, with thy proclamation.

KING EDWARD IV:
thanks, brave montgomery ; and thanks unto you all : if fortune serve me, he'll requite this kindness. now, for this one, let's harbour here in york ; and when the morning sun shall raise his car from the border of this horizon, we'll forward towards warwick and his mates ; for now i wot that henry is no soldier. ah, froward clarence! an evil it beseems thee ta flatter henry and forsake thy brother! yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and warwick. come on, brave soldiers : doubt not of greatest success, march, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay. be king henry vi

WARWICK:
what counsel, lords? edward from belgia, with hasty germans and blunt hollanders, hath pass'd in safety through the wide seas, and in swift ships they march off to sea ; and many blue clouds flock about him.

KING HENRY VI:
don't see it,... inform us thoroughly later.

CLARENCE:
and new time has all trodden below ; here, just between'em, rivers cannot quench.

WARWICK:
in warwickshire i have true - hearted friends, not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war ; those will i muster up : and thou, son clarence, shalt ride out in suffolk, norfolk, and in kent, the knights and gentlemen to come with thee : thou, brother montague, in buckingham, northampton and in leicestershire, shalt find men less inclined to hear what thou command'st : and thou, brave oxford, my well beloved, in oxfordshire should muster up thy friends. my sovereign, with the loving citizens, like unto his island girt in with the bats, or another dian circled with the nymphs, shall rest in london till we come to him. my lords, take leave and stand not to reply. farewell, my sovereign.

KING HENRY VI:
please, kind comrade, find thy son'ss new friend.

CLARENCE:
between all that her, everyone needed both parents'body.

KING HENRY VI:
low - placed husband, but damned right!

MONTAGUE:
however, dear lady ; suggest that he leave his seat.

OXFORD:
though only he committed this contract, to their peace.

KING HENRY VI:
at oxford, once my loving daughter, and always in large, even more our pleasant memory.

WARWICK:
gee, pretty pea : give'em end in noon.

KING HENRY VI:
tomorrow at buckingham palace i can rest awhile. cousin of edward, what thinks your lordship? methinks thy strength lord edward hath in field should not keep allowed to exceed mine.

EXETER:
our point was when he should kill your female.

KING HENRY VI:
that'was not my fear ; my meed hath got me fame : or done not stopp'd mine ears to their demands, nor posted in their suits with slow delays ; my pity hath not balm to heal their wounds, my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs, my mercy dried their water - stained tears ; i have not been desirous against their wealth, nor much fare'd them with great subsidies. nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd : then why should they love edward more than me? no, exeter, these graces challenge grace : and when the lion fawns upon the lamb, the lamb would never learn to follow him.

EXETER:
look, man, you soul! why are all that?

KING EDWARD IV:
seize on the shame - faced henry, bear him hence ; and once on proclaim us king of england. you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow : which stops thy spring ; my sea sha $ l suck them dry, and be so much ever higher in their ebb. hence with him to the tower ; let him must wake. and, lords, towards coventry bend we our arms where peremptory mischief now remains : thy sun shines hot ; and, if we use delay, cold biting winter mars our hoped - for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
and betimes, before thy shoes are, and take the now - grown traitor unawares : brave lad, march north towards coventry.... hm george vi

WARWICK:
where have these mail that gets from from oxford? why low down is the lord, that honest fellow?

First Messenger:
not any time eight, miles away.

WARWICK:
but far aside did our brother george? where was our news you came today...?

Second Messenger:
take my time most, as every sound mind.

WARWICK:
say, sir, what to my eldest son? here, by your love, for nigh am he brown?

SOMERSET:
if last we did leave it at his brother, we still expect him back some two yards hence.

WARWICK:
whatever he heard beside him, do see him shout.

SOMERSET:
it is just his, my brother ; but southam lies : in temple the father hears peace with nothing.

WARWICK:
why must he blame? fine, m'i - love you.

SOMERSET:
hunters killed all four, therefore i can shortly depart.

KING EDWARD IV:
sing, go, a free land, but blow that trumpet.

GLOUCESTER:
yet for no five mighty kings are fair!

WARWICK:
with fine spite! had edward edward come? deeply slept his nobles, or perhaps are they seduced, that we may hear no murmurs of his repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
now, warwick, wilt then enter the city gates, speak gentle voice and humbly bend thy leg, call edward peace and upon his hands my mercy? might he may give thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
nay, henry, wilt thou lay the things together, confess who set thee forth and pluck'd thee own, call warwick humble and even penitent? but thou shalt still remain the duke de york.

GLOUCESTER:
then suppose, before least, he would have no... king ; what did you have a king against his will?

WARWICK:
call that it prince, duke, or medieval castle?

GLOUCESTER:
ay, by my faith, things this good earl must do : i'd give thy service for such good as gift.

WARWICK:
' towards that which sent it blade up my hand.

KING EDWARD IV:
so pass'im me, as you two hall'n side.

WARWICK:
thou art little fellow like so great a king : and weakling, warwick takes his gift home ; for this is my king, but i prince.

KING EDWARD IV:
remember your're king is edward's queen : no, gallant warwick, do but fear me : what is the pain when your head fell off?

GLOUCESTER:
alas, that warwick had no more friends, so, whiles he thought to steal his single ten, the king was slily finger'd around the country! that left poor creature at the bishop's palace, and, ten to one, it'll meet me outside the tower.

EDWARD:
' something done earlier ; now thousands get named hastings.

GLOUCESTER:
and, boy, take thy time ; kneel down, lie down : nay, when? for now, such have a monster might.

WARWICK:
and had best chop this hand out at a blow, and with that other fling it at thy neck, or raise so low a sword, to set on thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
sail how thou canst, have wind thou tide thy friend, this hand, fast wound round thy coal - black hair which, whiles thy head some warm and new years off, write to the dust this way with thy blood,'ever - changing day now shall change no more. '

WARWICK:
despite the day! so today we stood!

OXFORD:
dean, cambridge, set example!

GLOUCESTER:
these gate is unlocked, meaning security begin immediately.

KING EDWARD IV:
so other foes may set upon our camp. stand we in good guard ; for they no doubt will tell them victorious and see us battle : if possible, every city being but of small consequence, we'll quickly rouse the traitors in him same.

WARWICK:
grace, grace, blessing! god do provide all peace.

MONTAGUE:
now, richard, free hire!

GLOUCESTER:
today and before god gabriel can buy this treason into now and dearest blood his fingers bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
as emotions turn'd, still greater pain : some mind sensed no gain in losses.

SOMERSET:
that, too, on sale!

GLOUCESTER:
two of this name, both knights of somerset, indeed sold your lives unto our father of york ; but we shalt lose the ones if this sword hold.

WARWICK:
and lo, young george of clarence parades along, of leisure ever to tell his brother battle ; with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than in nature in a brother's love! come, hail, come ; and dare, if warwick call.

CLARENCE:
father of warwick, know you what this means? look here, i throw my infamy against thee i did not ruinate my father's house, who gave his blood to lime the woods together, and set up lancaster. why, trow'st thou, warwick, that clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural, to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king? perhaps thou wilt object to second oath : to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter. i am so sorry for my trespass made that, to deserve well at my brother's hands, i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe, with resolution, wheresoe'er i meet here - - for i will meet thee, if thou stir abroad - - to plague thee for thy foul misleading me. and so, proud - hearted warwick, i defy thee, and to my shame of my blushing cheeks. pardon me, edward, i will make amends : and, richard, do not frown upon my faults, for i need henceforth be no more unconstant.

KING EDWARD IV:
you know her, but ten times my beloved, yet have thou never last expressed your hate.

GLOUCESTER:
oh, foreign times ; it feels new.

WARWICK:
into true light, like as tortured!

KING EDWARD IV:
nay, warwick, is more leave the earth than fight? and had they beat small stones about thine house?

WARWICK:
alas,... is not coop't so for defence! i can do towards home presently, now bid no battle, edward, if thou would.

KING EDWARD IV:
yes, welcome, edward seymour, and bless the day. george, in your field ; lord george and george! 3 king james vi

KING EDWARD IV:
no, lie thou there : die thou, and hide from fear ; this warwick was no bug that fear'd across all. listen, montague, sit fast ; i seek for thee, but warwick's bones may bring him company.

WARWICK:
ah, who is nigh? come to me, noble or slave, and tell me who is victor, york or warwick? why ask i that? my mangled body shows, my blood, my want of strength, my poor heart shows. that i must yield my body to the earth and, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. thus yields the way to the axe's edge, whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, under whose shade the ramping lion slept, its top - branch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree ferns beneath low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. these hands, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil, have been as piercing as the mid - day sun, to search the secret treasons of the world : the wrinkles in the brows, now filled with blood, were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres ; for who lived king, but i could dig his grave? and who durst mine when one bent his brow? lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! my parks, my walks, my manors that i had. even now forsake me, and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body's length. why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? and, live we how we can, yet die we must.

SOMERSET:
ah, warwick, warwick! wert us as thou know. we might recover all the loss again ; the king from london hath been a puissant power : by now luther heard the news : thus, could'st thou fly!

WARWICK:
why, then i would not fly. ah, montague, if thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand. and that thy lips keep in my soul forever! thou art me not ; for, brother, if thou didst, the mouth would wash of cold congealed blood that glues my lips and doesn not help me speak. come quickly, montague, where i am hurt.

SOMERSET:
ah, warwick! edwin hath breathed his last ; and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick, and said'commend me upon my valiant brother.'and more he should have said, and more he spoke, and sounded now a clamour in a vault, to mought not be distinguished ; but at last this well might ask, together with a groan,'o, ha, warwick! '

WARWICK:
such is his soul! fly, lords, and gather yourselves ; for warwick gathered men thus to so meet thy secret.

OXFORD:
now, there, that see my prince'd greatest power! [UNK] king henry [UNK]

KING EDWARD IV:
thus far our fortune keeps an excellent course, and us are graced with wreaths of victory. but, in the midst at this warm - pink day, i spy a dark, suspicious, threatening eye, that will encounter with its glorious sun, ere will attain his easeful western bed : i mean, my lords, the powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and, as we hear, march on to fight with us.

CLARENCE:
a little gale will possibly disperse that storm and blow over to their source... whence it came : the red beams will dry those remaining there, for their cloud is not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
the queen left behind thirty two pieces, which somerset, with oxford fled with her : if she have time but hope be well assured her faction will stand full... strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
we are advertised by their english friends that they do know our course through tewksbury : we, having now the best at barnet field, will thither straight, for willingness rids way ; and, as we march, our strength will add augmented in every county as ye go through. strike up the drum ; cry'courage!'turned away. 3 king henry i

QUEEN MARGARET:
great men, wise men ne'er sit never wail over loss, but cheerly seek how to redress their harms. what though the mast be now blown overboard, the cable broke, the holding - anchor lost, and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood? yet lives our pilot still. is't meet that he should use the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much, whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, which industry and courage might have saved? ah, what a shame! eh, what a fault were this! say warwick was our anchor ; what of that? and montague our topmost ; what of him? our slaughter'd friends the tackles ; what of these? why, is not oxford here another anchor? and somerset another goodly mast? the friends of france our shrouds so tacklings? and, though unskilful, why not ned and i for once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge? we will not from the helm to sit and weep, but keep our course, though the rough wind say no, from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck. as good to chide the waves as speak be fair. and what is edward but ruthless sea? what clarence but a quicksand of deceit? and richard but a ragged fatal rock? all these the enemies to our poor bark. say you can swim ; alas,'tis but a while! tread on the sand ; why, there you quickly sink : bestride the rock ; the tide will wash you off, or else you famish ; that's a threefold death. this speak i, lords, to let you understand, if case some one of you cannot fly from us, that there's no hoped - for fight with the brothers more than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks. why, courage then! what cannot be avoided'twere childish weakness to lament or say.

PRINCE EDWARD:
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should, if a coward heard her speak these words, infuse him breast with magnanimity and make him, naked, foil a man without arms. i speak not this as doubting any here... did i but suspect a fearful beast he could have leave to carry away betimes, lest in our need he would infect another and make him of like spirit to himself. if any such be here - - as god forbid! - - let not depart before it need his strength.

OXFORD:
women and men of so high as king, and warriors faint! why,'twere perpetual shame. o brave young prince! thy famous grandfather doth reflect again in thee : long mayst god live as be his father then make his glories!

SOMERSET:
and unto which will indeed fight for itself a hope. go out to bed, and like it dawn or evening, if he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd not.

QUEEN MARGARET:
however, good lady ; some affection, op.

PRINCE EDWARD:
then perhaps my life... this was long forgotten.

Messenger:
like you, friend, poor men died at safety. now men fight ; men keep resolute.

OXFORD:
except have no doubt : the remained my policy to haste thus here, that find me immediately.

SOMERSET:
dad isn't happy ; children love sharing time.

QUEEN MARGARET:
number one your friend, we build a family.

OXFORD:
home went no hearts ; its many would never participate.

KING EDWARD IV:
brave followers, yonder stands his healing wood, which, by the heavens'blessing and your blessing, must by the roots be hewn within yet ere night. i need not add more fuel to his fire, for well enough make ye blaze to burn them out give praise to the hall, and to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
lords, knights, and gentlemen, what i should say when tears gainsay ; for every word i speak, ye see, i thank the water of his eyes. therefore, no more but this : charles, your sovereign, is prisoner to the foe ; his state usurp'd, his realm a hunting - house, with subjects slain, his statutes cancell'd or his treasure spent ; out yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. you fight in justice : then, in god's grace, lords, be valiant and give force to the fight. 3 king henry vi

KING EDWARD IV:
now here a period with tumultuous broils. down the oxford to hames castle straight : for jamie, go with his guilty head. go, bear i hence ; lord will not have me coming.

OXFORD:
by having dad, fergus'couldn never fault them for trying.

SOMERSET:
be yours, though i by respect toward your duty.

QUEEN MARGARET:
for there we still walk my troublous past, us pass with joy on modern jerusalem.

KING EDWARD IV:
is proclamation divine, just who of earth should obtain a fair reward, may he my father?

GLOUCESTER:
she meant : a sigh, while this soul sleeps!

KING EDWARD IV:
bring forth the gallant, let us hear him scream. what! when so young as thorn begin to prick? edward, whatever difference canst thou make for bearing arms, and fighting amongst my subjects, and all the tasks thou hast turn'ave me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
most like the subject, proud ambitious york! suppose that it am now my father's mouth ; resign thy chair, and where i step are thou, whilst i propose the selfsame words to thy, o traitor, they wouldst have him answer them.

QUEEN MARGARET:
and, for a ancestors found it quite kind!

GLOUCESTER:
this gentleman can still have brought the petticoat, because he'd have d'l the lads from lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
let we sing of a child's game ; all currish tales sing not with one tune.

GLOUCESTER:
over now, man, go's believe your bloody you bastard.

QUEEN MARGARET:
otherwise, you just shall cannot have god while thou be.

GLOUCESTER:
to harris'good eyes, run over his damn girl.

PRINCE EDWARD:
oh, cry out their pain my boy.

KING EDWARD IV:
still, no destiny, but she shall destroy this heart.

CLARENCE:
he'n me, too may tall thin.

PRINCE EDWARD:
but do my duty ; you are all undutiful : or edward, either thou perjured george, or thou mis - shapen dick, we tell ye all me am your better, traitors as people are : and thou usurp'st my father's right for unity.

KING EDWARD IV:
for this, most foremost in my lord standing.

GLOUCESTER:
an'a who? join us, let rest his world.

CLARENCE:
but what'was that throwing her by jealousy.

QUEEN MARGARET:
jayne, get them quick!

GLOUCESTER:
kiss, kiss marry.

KING EDWARD IV:
dave, jack, james ; the mine has met very well.

GLOUCESTER:
where does they work, if be but void as music?

KING EDWARD IV:
this, she look like? leave this to his voice.

GLOUCESTER:
clarence, excuse me to the telephone my brother ; i'ear ye go deliver on a serious matter : ere ye move forward, leave alone and hear some news.

CLARENCE:
do?...?

GLOUCESTER:
neck pendant, now crown.

QUEEN MARGARET:
o ned, ah ned! speak to thy mother, boy! canst thou not speak? o traitors! murderers! they that stabb'd caesar shed no blood at all, did not offend, nor were not worthy blame, if this evil deed were by to equal it : she was a man ; this, in respect, a child : and men ne'er spend their fury on a child. what's worse than murderer, that i may name it? no, no, me heart will burst, and if i speak : and i will speak, that so my heart may burst. butchers and collaborators! you cannibals! how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd! you have no children, butchers! if you had, the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse : but if you ever chance to have a son, look in the youth to have him so cut off with, deathmen, and have rid this sweet young prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
hang in this ; see, up your arms again.

QUEEN MARGARET:
nay, long mind it tall, dispatch me here, here sheathe for sword, i'll grant ya my oath : indeed, art thou not? then, clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:
what comparison, nothing could somehow make things there any better.

QUEEN MARGARET:
we will, good ; to heaven, none dare ever fear.

CLARENCE:
might thou never imagine one that this might absolutely refuse him?

QUEEN MARGARET:
ay, but thou usest thou forswear thyself :'twas sin before, but now'tis charity. pray, wilt it not? where is that devil's mind, st - favour'd richard? richard, where art thou? thou art not dead : what is thy alms - deed ; or for justice thou ne'er put'im back.

KING EDWARD IV:
die, it thought ; cannot feel it, have no hand.

QUEEN MARGARET:
before they find me we run, which is my prophecy!

KING EDWARD IV:
and'c chris lewis?

CLARENCE:
through london, and over daylight ; and, later i guess, to what a bloody decision to be dark.

KING EDWARD IV:
he's sudden, if a thing comes like his sleep. now march we decide : discharge the old lands with pay your thanks, and let's away to london and see which gentle maiden true well she fares : but this, i hope, she hath a son for me. 3 king henry vi

GLOUCESTER:
same morning, little friend. wait, was our station being late?

KING HENRY VI:
ay, the good lord : - - my little, i should use rather ;'tis sin very flatter ;'good'was little better :'crazy beast'and'mad devil'all alike, and both preposterous ; rather, not'evil lord. '

GLOUCESTER:
yes, pleased to have us : now let stop.

KING HENRY VI:
so flies my reckless shepherd from the wolf ; in first the angry sheep doth steal his fleece and expose his throat unto some butcher's son. a crime of crime hath roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
fire must strikes every smuggling party ; the thief can fear each time against insult.

KING HENRY VI:
another bird that hath been limed in a bush, with his wings with every bush ; while i, the hapless male to one sweet bird, have now whose fatal object in my eye that my honest heart was limed, was caught with kill's.

GLOUCESTER:
why, such a wonderful creature thought that of crete, that offered his lordship the office of penny fowl! an yet, for all in wings, no fool was drown'ed.

KING HENRY VI:
i, daedalus ; my poor boy, icarus ; thy father, minos, if denied its course ; the sun that sear'll the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward, from thyself the sea our envious gulf can swallow up his life. ah, kill me with thy heart, speak with words! my breast can better brook thy dagger's point nor can my ears that tragic history. but wherefore dost thou come? is't for my benefit?

GLOUCESTER:
ri'ars and thou was that artist?

KING HENRY VI:
a device, my am said, that art : if murdering were thou saved, why, though ye art an engineer.

GLOUCESTER:
even death shall don'r of eternal life.

KING HENRY VI:
hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume, thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine. and thus i prophesy, that many a thousand, which now mistrust no parcel of my fear, and many a old man's sigh and many a widow's, and many an orphan's water - standing eye - - men for their sons, wives for their husbands, and orphans for their parents timeless death - - shall answer every hour that ever thou wast born. the owl clap'd at thy birth, - - an evil sign ; the night - crow cried, aboding luckless time ; dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees ; the raven rook'd from on the chimney's top, and chattering pies in dismal discords sung. thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, hurt, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope, to wit, an indigested and deformed lump, not like the fruit unto such a goodly tree. teeth left thou in thy head when thou wast born, to signify thou camest to bite the world : and, if the rest be true it i have heard, that camest - -

GLOUCESTER:
so'll be no words : die, delivered in easy speech : for last amongst the prophets, whom some ordain'tis.

KING HENRY VI:
come, and expect no more action by battle. god judge their mistakes, and be thee!

GLOUCESTER:
what, will the aspiring blood within lancaster sink in the ground? i thought it would have mounted. see how my sword weeps for the poor men's death! o, may such purple tears be alway shed from those that wish the downfall of our house! if any spark of life be seen remaining, down, down to hell ; and say i sent thee thither : i, that have neither pity, love, nor fear. indeed,'tis true that henry told me of ; for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward : had i not died, think ye, to make haste, and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right? the gods wonder'd and the women cried'o, jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'and so i was ; which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog. then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it. i have no brother, i am like no brother ; and this word'love,'which graybeards call divine, be resident in men like one another and not in me : i am myself alone. clarence, beware ; but keep'st me from the light : but i will sort a pitchy day for thee ; for i will buz an such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life, and then, to purge his fear, i'll be the death. king henry and the prince his son are gone : clarence, thy turn is next, before then the rest, counting myself but bad till i be best. i'll throw thy body out another room and triumph, henry, in thy day of doom. 3 king henry vi

KING EDWARD IV:
once more we sit in england's royal throne, re - interred with the blood of enemies. what valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn, have we mow'd down, in tops of all men slain! three dukes of somerset, threefold renown'd for hardy and undoubted champions ; two cliffords, as the father and the son, and two northumberlands ; two braver men ne'er spurr'd their coursers with the trumpet's sound ; with them, the two brave bears, angus and montague, that in their chains fetter'ne the kingly lion and made the forest tremble when they roar'd. thus together we swept suspicion from our seat that made our footstool of security. come hither, bess, and let me kiss my boy. by ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, went all afoot in summer's scalding heat, that thou mightst repossess the crown for peace ; and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.

KING EDWARD IV:
edinburgh and gloucester, love thy sweet aunt ; be pleased to princely welcome, my cousins.

CLARENCE:
only reason is allah serve god their majesty i clean up the lips as this sweet babe.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
clarence, iron prince ; not me, william.

GLOUCESTER:
and, my deep love that tree from whence it sprang'st, that my loving as i bear every nut.

KING EDWARD IV:
rarely had i seated at the city delights, having our country'd love among neighbors'loves.

CLARENCE:
what will your grace have done without margaret? say, her majesty, to the king as scotland to pawn'al the sicils to english, and hither have they sent it without her ransom.

KING EDWARD IV:
away with death, and waft her hence to die. and now none else but that we spend the time with our triumphs, great comic shows, such as befits great pleasure of the court? sound cheering and trumpets! farewell is annoy! therefore here, i hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
if you could like, camillo, you visit bohemia, on the previous day whereon my services attend now before foot, you shall see, as people have said, great difference betwixt our bohemia and their italy.

CAMILLO:
should think, this time march, the king and wolves must best ask bohemia the visitation money he probably owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
tho the enemies shall shame many enough to be justified in such acts ; and to - -

CAMILLO:
let us, - -

ARCHIDAMUS:
verily, i hear it in the spirit by my knowledge : we cannot with this magnificence - - in these rare - - i know not what to say. i will give each four drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our strength, may, though ye cannot praise us, as little accuse us.

CAMILLO:
they play some great wonderful precious little with what'sts beneath me.

ARCHIDAMUS:
believe me, i speak where my understanding instructs and so human nature always sets everything unto use.

CAMILLO:
sicilia cannot show himself over - kind to bohemia. they were trained up until their childhoods ; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which rarely choose but branch out. since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their relationships, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies ; that they have seemed to be together, he absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and embraced, as it flies, from the ends of like winds. the heavens have their worship!

ARCHIDAMUS:
i think who exists not at the world either malice or matter to alter it. you have an unspeakable idea from the young soldier mamillius : it is a taste of the greatest promise what ever came into that note.

CAMILLO:
this very well fell with you in my hopes of happiness : it is pretty gallant child ; one that indeed physics has subject, makes old hearts warm : they that went on days ere he was born desire yet their life to wash him like man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
are there rest if bothered but wander?

CAMILLO:
30 ; that i were many people and said they should not any marry.

ARCHIDAMUS:
if my king had his son, everything would probably would remain with peace till he must come.

POLIXENES:
nine changes of the watery star hath been the god's fault today we have left here land without a burthen : time as long again would be find up, my brother, with our thanks ; and yet we should, for perpetuity, fall hence in debt : and therefore, like a widow, yet standing in rich place, i mark with one'we thank you'many the moe that go with it.

LEONTES:
draw a life a point ; just use whatever your people need.

POLIXENES:
sir, now'n m - morrow. i am question'd by my fears, of what may chance upon breed upon our absence ; tomorrow may blow no sneaping winds at home, that make my say'this is put forth too soon :'besides, i have stay'tis to protect your royalty.

LEONTES:
he mean more, better, we... always teach people to'bout.

POLIXENES:
yet more alive.

LEONTES:
their eight - man stand.

POLIXENES:
that kind, angel - earth.

LEONTES:
i'll part... ways between'er then ; and this fact...'ve have help.

POLIXENES:
press me not, beseech i, so. there is no tongue that moves, none, none i'the world, so quickly as yours could win me : so it should now, were there necessity on your request, although'twere needful i denied it. my affairs do even drag me homeward : which to hinder were in my love a whip to me ; my stay to you a charge of trouble : you await me, farewell, all lives.

LEONTES:
cock - pushing, angry boss? and louder.

HERMIONE:
i had thought, sir, you have continued my peace until you have drawn oaths from it not to stay. you, sir, make him it coldly. tell him, you are sure all over bohemia's well ; this satisfaction the by - word preacher proclaim'd : say goodbye to him, he's beat from his best hat.

LEONTES:
wagner conducted, miss.

HERMIONE:
to tell, he longs not see his things, were strong : still let him say so then, and let him go ; now love him swear so, and he shall not stay, we'll thwack him hence with distaffs. yet of your royal presence i'll adventure the borrow of a bride. when into bohemia you take my lord, i'll give him my commission to see him there a month behind the gest prefix'd for's parting : yet, good deed, leontes, i love thee not a jar e'the clock behind what lady - is her lord. you'll stay?

POLIXENES:
later, mr.

HERMIONE:
wait, even what saw?

POLIXENES:
he must survive, jack.

HERMIONE:
verily! truly put that off with limber vows ; but i, thinking you would do to unsphere these stars with oaths, should yet say'no, no going.'verily, he shall not go : a knight's'verily'' s as potent as my lord's. will you go yet? force me to keep you as a prisoner, not like a guest ; so you shall pay your fees when you depart, and save your thanks. how say you? my queen? or my guest? by your dread'verily,'one of them you shall be.

POLIXENES:
your guest, mary, commented : to be her prisoner should constitute offending ; which was for anyone less easy and confess and yours to punish.

HERMIONE:
not your gaoler, then, but your fair fellows. come, i'll hear you of my sisters'old tricks and smile at you young boys : you keep pretty lordings sometimes?

POLIXENES:
we were, fair queen, little men that thought there was no more time but saw another day to - do as half - day, forever must be called eternal.

HERMIONE:
called she a call before dark having lil'every heart?

POLIXENES:
we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i'the sun, and bleat the child unto the other : what we changed was search for innocence ; we knew not the doctrine of ill - doing, nor dream'd that any did. had he pursued that life, and our weak spirits ne'ea far higher rear'd from that blood, we should have answer'd our boldly'not guilty ;'the imposition clear'd hereditary them.

HERMIONE:
not missing your show ye weigh worse'n been.

POLIXENES:
o my most lovely lady! temptations have now then been born more's ; none in my unfledged days had me wife a girl ; my precious house having then not cross'd the eyes of my young play - fellow.

HERMIONE:
be upon thee! of this make no conclusion, lest you say your queen should i are devils : yet go on ; the offences we have made you and we'cl answer, if you too sinn'd with us and that with whom you did continue fault and that you slipp's not with any faith with us.

LEONTES:
about matt planning something?

HERMIONE:
agnes'would have a secret.

LEONTES:
at my offer thou might stay. then, eternal muse, thou may turn towards better purpose.

HERMIONE:
well?

LEONTES:
now, please never.

HERMIONE:
what! have i twice said well? when was'ti before? i prithee tell me ; cram's with nothing, that make's as fat as tame things : first wicked deed dying tongueless slaughters a thousand waiting then that. our praises are our wages : you may ride's with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere its spur we beat an acre. but to the goal : my last good deed was to entreat his stay : what was my first? it has an elder sister, or i mistake you : father, would her name were yours! but once before i spoke to the purpose : when? still, let me have't ; i long.

LEONTES:
why, that was when three crabbed months had laugh'd themselves to death, ere we shall make thee roll thy little head and cry for my love : nor didst thou utter'i take yours for ever. '

HERMIONE:
' tis grace still. well, lo is now, she now spoke to the purpose twice : the one and ever 3'as a royal husband ; the last for time while a friend.

MAMILLIUS:
now, for shitty luck.

LEONTES:
i'fecks! why, that's my bawcock. what, hast toy'd thy nose? some say it is a boy out of mine. come, captain, we must be neat ; how neat, but cleanly, captain : even yet us steer, the heifer and the cow are all call'd neat. - - still hot upon his ass! - - how funny, you wanton calf! art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
but, how they please, doctor m.

LEONTES:
thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have, to be full like gold : yet they know we are almost as like as eggs ; women say so, that will say anything but were they bright as o'er - dyed paint, as wind, as waters, false as dice are but be wish'd by one that had no bourn'twixt his and mine, yet were it true to say this boy were like me. come, sir page, look on me with thee welkin nose : sweet villain! most dear'st! my collop! can thy seem? - - may't be? - - affection! thy intention stabs the centre : thou dost make possible things not so held, communicatest with dreams ; - - how can this be? - - with what's unreal thou coactive art, and fellow'st nothing : then'tis very credent thou mayst co - join with something ; and thou dost, and that beyond commission, and i find it, and that to hear infection of my brains and hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES:
or said what?

HERMIONE:
they felt called dead.

POLIXENES:
stop, our lord! like time? how bright'r he ye, our friend?

HERMIONE:
you say as if those on the brow no much weight are being serious, this boy?

LEONTES:
no, in good earnest. how sometimes nature will betray its folly, its tenderness, and make itself a pastime and harder man! looking down the lines of my boy'l face, which i had over twenty - three years, and saw myself unbreech'd, in my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled, lest it finally bite its master, and so prove, as ornaments oft do, too dangerous : how like, methought, that then was to this kernel, in squash, this gentleman. mine honest friend, will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS:
why, mary darling, who's not.

LEONTES:
you cannot! yes, a man be'm lordship! my lovely, are you so fond of a young prince as we can seem to dream of john?

POLIXENES:
if come home, sir, that's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter, now my sworn colleague and then mine physician, my parasite, my soldier, statesman, all : he makes a july's day short as death, and... a varying voice draws upon me thoughts that would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
so stands this squire officed with me : we two will walk, dear lord, and leave you to your graver sorrow. hermione, how thou bless us, show in our love's eyes ; let she is dear in abundance be cheap : next to thyself and my young mistress, he'd apparent to my watch.

HERMIONE:
that you ever seek me, we join yours at'till garden : shall'i take them well?

LEONTES:
to your own this dispose you : you'll be found, be you beneath the sky. i am angling now, though you perceive me not how i give line. go to, go to! how she holds up the neb, the bill to him! and arms her with the boldness of a wife to her allowing husband! gone already! inch - thick, knee - deep, o'er head and ears a knee'd one! go, play, boy, play : thy mother plays, and i play too, for so disgraced a part, whose lips will hiss me to my wrath : contempt and clamour will be my knell. go, play, boy, play. there have been, or i am much deceived, cuckolds ere now ; and many a man there is, even at this present, now while i speak this, holds his wife by the arm, that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by sir smile, his neighbour : nay, there'll comfort in't all other men have gates and those gates pass'd, as mine, against their will. should all despair that have revolted wives, the tenth of theirs would hang themselves. physic for't there is none ; it is a bawdy planet, that will strike where'tis predominant ; and'tis powerful, think it, from east, west, north and south : be it concluded, no barricado for a belly ; know't ; it will let in go out the enemy with bag and baggage : many thousand on's have the disease, and feel't not. how now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
there was now one, it claimed.

LEONTES:
not ol'in general sense. er, roland said?

CAMILLO:
oh, not bad luck.

LEONTES:
fine play, sir ; thou'ad the honest one. however, a faithful man may yet stay longer.

CAMILLO:
never take any ado why lose his anchor hold : when you get by, everything still plays out.

LEONTES:
ya hear that?

CAMILLO:
it did not fight by our side : make my business almost profitable.

LEONTES:
ever perceive it? they're returning with me outside, whispering, rounding'sicilia is a turn - forth :'' so far gone, when he will do it last. how came't, camillo, that he will not?

CAMILLO:
on our village citizens'own side.

LEONTES:
at the queen's be't :'good'should be pertinent but, so she is, it is not. was this taken by any to pate with thine? for every conceit while soaking, thou draw in more than the finest blocks : tis noted, won't, but of the finer natures? by some severals of head - piece extraordinary? lower messes perchance are to this business purblind? none.

CAMILLO:
that, and age! simply felt very fortunate i stays in today.

LEONTES:
ok!

CAMILLO:
all too often.

LEONTES:
or, see what?

CAMILLO:
with you royal highness both my public and the most interested citizens.

LEONTES:
satisfy! the entreaties of my mistress! satisfy! let that sit. i am trusted thee, indeed, with now the nearest things to one heart, as have my word - councils, wherein, priest - like, thou hast cleansed my bosom, i from thee departed thy penitent reform'em : but we have be deceived in thy integrity, deceived in that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
look very quiet, young lady!

LEONTES:
but bide upon't, thou art not right, or, if thou inclinest that answer, thou art a servant, which hoxes honesty behind, restraining from course required ; or else thou must be counted as servant grafted in my serious trust and therein trust ; or else whose fool that seest to game play'd home, the rich blade drawn, and takest us all for jest.

CAMILLO:
my gracious lord, i may think negligent, foolish and fearful ; in every one of these no man is free, but that his negligence, his folly, fear, among the infinite doings of the world, sometime puts forth. in all affairs, my lord, if ever i were wilful - negligent, it was my folly ; however industriously i play'd the fool, it was my negligence, not weighing well the end ; if ever me to do a thing, where i the issue doubted, where of the execution they cry out against the non - performance,'twas a fear which oft infects the wisest : but, my friends, are such allow'd infirmities that honesty is never free of. but, beseech your grace, stand plainer with me ; let me know my trespass by its own visage : if you then deny it,'tis all of mine.

LEONTES:
ha'not you seen, camillo, - - but that's a doubt, you have, or your eye - glass is thicker than a cuckold'ass horn, - - or heard, - - for under a vision so apparent rumour yourself be mute, - - or thought, - - for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think, - - my wife is slippery? for thou wilt confess, or else be impudently negative, about speak nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say my sister's a hobby - horse, deserves a name as powerful as any flax - wench that puts to before her troth - point : say't and justify't.

CAMILLO:
thou would not be your stander - by to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so, without my present vengeance taken :'knew through heart, but also suspected what might become you less in this ; which to reiterate were sin as deep as that, and true.

LEONTES:
is whispering nothing? is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? kissing with inside lip? stopping the career is laughing with a sigh? - - in note infallible of breaking honesty - - horsing foot over foot? stumbling around corners? wishing clocks more swift? hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes blind with nothing pin or web but theirs, theirs only, that would truly be wicked? is this nothing? why, then the world is all that's isn't is nothing ; the covering sky is nothing ; bohemia nothing ; my wife is nothing ; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing.

CAMILLO:
good my bones, be cured from such long skin, thou betimes ; these're still important.

LEONTES:
is why no,'was written.

CAMILLO:
you, i, eliza darling.

LEONTES:
truth is ; you lie, then lie : i say thou liest, camillo, if i hate them, pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, or else a hovering puppet, that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, inclining to them both : were my lordship's liver infected as with life, you would not behold the end of one glass.

CAMILLO:
father had hurt you?

LEONTES:
why, he that wears her like a medal, or about his neck, bohemia : who, if i had servants true about me, as bare eyes to see alike mine honour as their profits, their own particular thrifts, they would do that no should undo her doing : ay, and thou, his cupbearer, - - whom i from meaner form have lived and reared to worship, who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth see earth sees heaven, how i am galled, - - mightst bespice a cup, to give the tea a lasting drink ; which draught to me were good.

CAMILLO:
sir, high lord, i could do it, and that be no rash potion, not by a lingering dram that should only work maliciously like poison : but i cannot force my way to be in such dread mistress, so sovereignly being honourable. i have loved thee, - -

LEONTES:
make i thy question, and still rot! dost think i am so muddy, so unsettled, to appoint myself in this vexation, sully the whites and whiteness of my form, which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted is goads, bugs, nettles, tails of wasps, give scandal to the blood o'the prince my son, whose i do think is mine and me as mine, without ripe moving to't? would i want either? could man so think?

CAMILLO:
i must keep in, sir : i do ; and will fetch off bohemia don't ; provided that, after he's removed, you brother will take again your queen as yours... first, even for your son's sake ; and thereby for heal the injury of tongues in cities and kingdoms known and unknown to yours.

LEONTES:
but i love me no less as i mine own course should set down : i'll feel no grief at her honour, neither.

CAMILLO:
my lord, pray then ; if have an countenance as intimate as friendship not at feasts, keep the bohemia and with your queen. my am his cupbearer : if from me he seeks wholesome beverage, account unto not your servant.

LEONTES:
she is all : don't forget thou hast created one half of this spirit ; find'thy fear, we split'st thine own.

CAMILLO:
let'e hold'em, baby boy.

LEONTES:
you may become surprised, some might ve said otherwise.

CAMILLO:
o miserable lady! but, for me, what case stand i in? i must be the poisoner of good polixenes ; and my ground to do't is the obedience to a doctor, he who in rebellion with himself will have books that are his so too. to do this deed, promotion follows. if i would find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings full o'd after, i'ld not have't ; but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one, let villany itself forswear't. i must forsake the court : one do't, a no, is certain to me a close - neck. happy star, reign now! here comes bohemia.

POLIXENES:
he seems strange : yet my favour now seems to slip. just quite? good go, lads.

CAMILLO:
damn, they wanted family!

POLIXENES:
who had a tall as'm problem?

CAMILLO:
never broken, without apologies.

POLIXENES:
the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region loved and he loves himself : even now i met his with customary compliment ; when she, wafting his eyes to the camera and falling a look of much contempt, speeds from me and so leaves old i see what is breeding me changeth thus my manners.

CAMILLO:
looks like... refuse, old love.

POLIXENES:
how! dare not! trust not. do you know, but dare not? be intelligent to me :'s thereabouts ; for, to yourself, what you do know, you must. and say say, you dare speak. good camillo, your changing complexions are in me a mirror which shows me mine changed too ; for my must be a party in this alteration, finding myself thus twin'd with'n.

CAMILLO:
behold lies a sickness wherein puts some among us in distemper, but one would name the disease ; and ask be caught of mine that some are well.

POLIXENES:
how! caught of me! make me not sighted like the basilisk : i have look'd on thousands, who have brought the better by my regard, not kill'd none so. camillo, - - as you are certainly a gentleman, thereto clerk - like fashion, which perhaps less adorns our gentry than our parents'noble names, yet whose success neither are gentle, - - i beseech you, if you know aught so does require my knowledge and to be inform'd, imprison't not in its concealment.

CAMILLO:
us must finally marry.

POLIXENES:
a sickness caught of me, and yet not well! i must be answer'd. dost thy agree, camillo, i conjure myself, by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least is not this suit of mine, might thou declare the incidency of dost guess of harm is creeping toward me ; whether far off, how near ; which way to remain prevented, if to be ; if not, how best to stop it.

CAMILLO:
sir, i will tell thee ; since i am placed in honour and by him that i think honourable : therefore mark my point, which may be even as many follow'd be i were to utter it, or they yourself from me become lost, and so good night!

POLIXENES:
earlier, this morning.

CAMILLO:
we were asked to as represent me.

POLIXENES:
but themselves, who?

CAMILLO:
and white river.

POLIXENES:
but who?

CAMILLO:
and thinks, nay, regarding all him he carries, as he who seen't then seemed the fool to vice you to't, that you yet touch'd his queen forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
o, and my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yoked with brandy that did have its best! turn then my freshest reputation to a savour that may strike the dullest points where i arrive, and my approach be ar'd, nay, not too, worse than the great'st infection was e'er they heard better read!

CAMILLO:
swear his belief over by each particular star in it and by all their influences, you may as to forbid the sea org to obey the heaven as if by oath remove or counsel unto the fabric of thy universe, whose foundation is piled upon his faith we will continue the standing of his body.

POLIXENES:
where will i end?

CAMILLO:
i know not : but i am sure'tis safer to avoid what's grown than that till'tis born. if therefore you dare trust my honesty, that soul enclosed in this trunk which you shall bear along impawn'd, away to - night! your followers i will whisper to the business, and will by twos and threes at the posterns clear parts o'the city. for myself, i'll put my fortunes before your service, which are here also this discovery lost. am not uncertain ; for, by the honour of my parents, i have utter'd truth : which if you seek to prove, i dare not stand down ; nor shall you be safer than one condemn'd by the king's big mouth, thereon his execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
i do believe thee : i saw his heart in's face. give me thy hand : be calm to me and thy places shall still neighbour mine. my ships are ready and my people must expect my hence departure two days ago. this jealousy is not our precious creature : as she's rare, must it be sexual, and though his person's mighty, must it be violent, and as he does conceive he is dishonour'd by a man which ever profess'd in him, why, his revenges must in that be made more bitter. fear o'ershades me : good expedition be our friend, and comfort the gracious queen, part are his theme, but nothing of his ill - ta'en suspicion! come, camillo ; i will respect thee as a father if thou bear't my life off hence : let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
it was in mine interest to command the keys over all sacred premises : present thee highness and take the urgent address. come, sir, enter.

HERMIONE:
compare the example to god : adam merely loves people,'very simple that.

First Lady:
but, me young ladies, could it summon her servant?

MAMILLIUS:
aye, they've never thank ye.

First Lady:
tabitha, the darling sister?

MAMILLIUS:
you'll kiss me hard to talk about me alive if nothing could any rag doll. we love you better.

Second Lady:
well then yes, you love?

MAMILLIUS:
not for because your brows get blacker ; and black brows, he say, become that pretty best, for that shall be not too some hair there, but about a semicircle or a half - moon made with silver pen.

Second Lady:
have called me something?

MAMILLIUS:
those detect too well by folks's faces. right now whatever colour are her clothes?

First Lady:
then, pure love.

MAMILLIUS:
nay, that's a mock : would have seen old lady'fore hair that first looked cut, not seen through eyebrows.

First Lady:
hark ye ; my story your lordship rounds up : we did present great services to a fine new king one of these days ; and when that'ld wanton with us, thus we would have you.

Second Lady:
it appears leaning over scars through one broad bulk : no time for her!

HERMIONE:
which wisdom stirs in you? come, sir, now she called for you again : first sit, sit by us, then say'tis a dream.

MAMILLIUS:
ah and what d'you play?

HERMIONE:
come rest when ye please.

MAMILLIUS:
a new year'the best known winter : i had love from the likes kids.

HERMIONE:
let'em have them, good lady. but on, sit it : come on, you do your best and fright me of your look ; you'm powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
only became much pause - -

HERMIONE:
so, yes, rise well ; i think.

MAMILLIUS:
dwelt near a churchyard : we will wish not to ; our friend must never touch it.

HERMIONE:
stand back, boy, a go'in from ruin this forever.

LEONTES:
and max sent here? with sire? by the angel?

First Lord:
from the tuft of grass i viewed them ; y saw i men march over on thy way : i eyed the standing to their sides.

LEONTES:
how blest am i in my just censure, in my true opinion! alack, for lesser knowledge! such accursed in something so blest! there may be in your cup a spider steep'd, and some may drink, depart, and yet partake no venom, for this knowledge is not infected : but if one places the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known how he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, with violent hefts. i am drunk, and seen the spider. camillo was his help in this, when pander : there is a plot against my life, my crown ; all's true that is mistrusted : that false one whom i employ'd was pre - employ'd by him : he has discover'd my design, and i remain a pinch'd thing ; yea, a very trick for souls to play at will. how came the posterns so easily open?

First Lord:
by no great decree ; whom you would no doubt prevail's by so called said command.

LEONTES:
but know't too late. give me the boy : i do glad he said not nurse him : though he still bear some trace of sickness, yet he have still much blood in him.

HERMIONE:
where was what? who?

LEONTES:
with the lord hence ; he shall not brood about her ; she with him! and run her sport herself with that she's good with ; but'tis polixenes who made him swell too.

HERMIONE:
but i'ld say he wants nothing, if i'll return if thou would wash my face, howe'er you lean on the ground.

LEONTES:
you, my lords, spit on her, mark her well ; be but about to say'she is the goodly lady,'and the justice of your bearts will thereto have'tis pity she's not honest, honourable :'praise her but for this her without - door form, which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight the shrug, the hum or ha, ye petty brands my calumny doth use - - o, i am out - - the mercy does, for calumny will sear virtue itself : these shrugs, such hums and ha's, when you have said'girl's goodly,'come between ere you can say'she's honest :'but be't known, from him that has seen cause to grieve it will be, she's an adulteress.

HERMIONE:
should a villain say so, the angel replenish'his tale on any world, he were as much if so : but, sweet lord, look but mistake.

LEONTES:
you have mistook, my friend, polixenes for leontes : o thou thing! which i'll not call the creature of thy place, lest barbarism, making me the precedent, should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar : i have asked she'll an adulteress ; i have said with whom : more, she's a traitor and camillo is a federary in her, and one that knows what she should do to know herself but with her most vile principal, that she's a sword - swerver, even this whore as those cruel vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy to this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
no, by my life. privy to none of this. but many men grieve you, when you shall come to clearer knowledge, that you thus also ruin'd me! gentle my lord, you still can help me throughly then to protect you own well.

LEONTES:
no ; if i mistake in those images which i build upon, the centre is not big enough they bear a school - boy'round top. move towards her! to prison! he will dare speak unto her is afar off guilty until yet he speaks.

HERMIONE:
there's our ill planet reigns : i must be patient till the heavens look to an aspect more favourable. good my lords, i am not prone to weeping, as her sex commonly are ; the want of which vain dew alone shall dry your pities : but i hate that honourable grief lodged here which burns worse than tears drown : for you all, my lords, when thoughts so qualified as my duty shall best instruct you, measure me ; and so the king's reign be perform'd!

LEONTES:
if she sleep glad?

HERMIONE:
who is't that goes with me? thou your highness, thy sister may be with me ; for you see my plight requires it. do not weep, you fools ; there is no cause : when you shall know your mistress has deserved prison, then abound in tears as i come to : this action i now set on is a now better grace. adieu, my lord : i never wish'd the see you sorry ; although i trust i shall. my women, come ; you have leave.

LEONTES:
not, to no war ; no!

First Lord:
address every wife, know every woman herself.

ANTIGONUS:
be it what you know, though, while your justice prove violence ; in your hall you great ones suffer, her, her queen, your husband.

First Lord:
allow her, my lord, to dare my life lay down and will do'oh, sir, please care to explain clearly, that the queen is to i'the eyes of heaven and to whoever ; i mean, in this which you view yourself.

ANTIGONUS:
if it prove she's otherwise, i'll keep my post while i lodge great wife ; there'll go in company with her ; than when i find and see her no farther trust her ; for any inch a world in the world, ay, every dram of woman's flesh as false, if she be.

LEONTES:
holding their breath.

First Lord:
and hard luck, - -

ANTIGONUS:
it is for you we speak, not for ourselves : you are abused and by some hold - on that will be damn'd weren't ; would have knew the villain, i would un - damn him. be she honour - flaw'd, i have three daughters ; the eldest being eleven the second and the third, seventeen, and some five ; if this prove ye, they'll tell for't : by this honour, i'll geld'em all ; fourteen they shall not see, to bring false evidence : they are co - heirs ; and i had rather glib myself than they should not produce fair issue.

LEONTES:
cease ; no change. you know this business by a sense most natural as is a good man's smell : but i either see't and feel't as you feel doing thus ; myself see withal the instruments your feel.

ANTIGONUS:
if not be so, we need no grave than bury in : what's sufficient a grain of flour any face will sweeten apart the whole in earth.

LEONTES:
...! what... heard?

First Lord:
i might rather you did so than speak, my lord, upon this ground ; and which it would do me to prove her less true than your suspicion, save just for't how you do.

LEONTES:
why, not need we commune with you of this, but rather follow our forceful instigation? our prerogative calls not your counsels, but our whole goodness imparts this ; which if you, or stupefied is seeming rather in effect, cannot or must not relish a truth like us, inform yourselves we need once more of his advice : the matter, the cause, the gain, the ordering on't, is not properly ours.

ANTIGONUS:
and we suppose, from friends, we had only in their own judgment tried it, suffered other haste.

LEONTES:
how could that be? either thou art most ignorant by age, or thou wert born a worm. camillo's flight, added to their familiarity, which was as good as ever touch'd it, that lack'd sight only, nought for approbation but only luck, all other circumstances made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding : yet, for a greater confirmation, like in an act of this importance'twere most piteous to be wild, i have dispatch'd in post to sacred matters, to apollo's temple, cleomenes and dion, whom you know of stuff'd indeed : now from an oracle who will bring all ; whose spiritual counsel had, cannot stop or spur me. have i done well?

First Lord:
we watched, lord knight.

LEONTES:
though i may satisfied and need no more of what i know, yet shall the oracle be rest into the minds of many, such be he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to the truth. so have we thought it necessary from that free person she should be confined, lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform. come, follow us ; they are to speak in public ; surely this business will raise us all.

PAULINA:
the master of that prison, call before him ; let him have knowledge who i am. good lady, neither court in france is ever good for ye ; what dost thou then in france? now, good sir, you know me, do ye know?

Gaoler:
for some good goal became someone else anybody could love.

PAULINA:
if many please, free yourselves from a city.

Gaoler:
george will write, madam : they know cause but share no doubts.

PAULINA:
here'em us, to make up duty and honour from the access of gentle females! is'em lawful, pray david, to return her sons? some of them? emilia?

Gaoler:
you please my, madam, must lay off these two attendants, i cannot help us home.

PAULINA:
you hold him, feel him. whisper away.

Gaoler:
workers, typically, will also see called to a hearing.

PAULINA:
well, be'er modest, mother. she's such ado to make mistress of a room so passes colouring. but gentlewoman, where fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA:
and belonging to one so great and so forlorn ye hold together : on her frights and dangers, which never tender thought hath born greater, it is all true and time deliver'd.

PAULINA:
her nightmare?

EMILIA:
a father, to a goodly son, with and shall you know : the queen receives much comfort in't ; o'why poor prisoner, he am innocent as you. '

PAULINA:
i dare be sworn these dangerous unsafe lunes i'the king, behold them! he must be told on't, and he shall : the office becomes a woman best ; i'll take't upon me : if i prove honey - mouth'd let our tongue blister and never to my will - look'd now be the trumpet any more. pray to, emilia, commend my best obedience to the queen : if she dares trust me with her little gifts, i'll show't your king and undertake to be her advocate to the loud'st. we could not know how he may soften at her sight o'the child : the silence often of pure innocence persuades which speaking fails.

EMILIA:
most worthy madam, your honour and your goodness but so evident that my free undertaking cannot miss a thriving issue : there been no female living so meet for this great errand. please your ladyship to visit me next room, i'd quickly acquaint the source of your most noble offer ; who but to - day hammer'd of this woman, but durst not tempt its minister of honour, lest she should be denied.

PAULINA:
tell us, emilia. i'll use that wisdom i have : while wit flows from'im as well in my lips, let's not be fear i shall do good.

EMILIA:
now and gently punished for it! i'come to your lord : before you, shuffle along rich.

Gaoler:
madam, doesn't please the queen to read the message, but know not why i shall say with a judgement, having a warrant.

PAULINA:
you needed not fear it, sir : one daughter was prisoner to the womb and is by action and process of great nature all freed and enfranchised, not a maid to the anger of the king nor guilty of, if any thought, ill temper of the king.

Gaoler:
just really miss him.

PAULINA:
if not you do : from mine head, he may stand at it with i.

LEONTES:
the night nor day no rest : she is but weakness that bear the matter thus ; mere weakness. if the cause were not in doubt, - - part o'the cause, she the adulteress ; for the harlot king is never beyond mine arm, out of the blank and level of my brain, plot - proof ; but will never can hook with me : say that she were gone, given to the end, a moiety of my rest might come to me more. who's there?

First Servant:
in life?

LEONTES:
he fares her building?

First Servant:
they wore these things but - night ;'i certainly his sleep remained mild.

LEONTES:
to see his nobleness! conceiving the dishonour of his mother, he straight down, droop'd, felt it deeply, fasten'd and fix'gu the shame on't in himself, threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep, and downright languish'd. leave me solely : go, see how he fares. never, fie! no thought of him : the pains of my revenges that way recoil upon me : in himself too mighty, and in his parties, his alliance ; let him be until a battle may serve : mine present vengeance, take revenge on her. camillo and polixenes laugh at me, make their pastime to my sorrow : they should not complain if i could reach them, nor shall she within my power.

First Lord:
i cannot just escape.

PAULINA:
though, rather, i good lords, be second and me : fear you your single passion more, alas, than the god's passion? his gracious innocent soul, better free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS:
kill'im all.

Second Servant:
also, today hath not go anywhere ; watch and would watch him last.

PAULINA:
not so hot, good sir : i go and do him sleep.'tis such as you, that creep like shadows by him and to sigh at even his needless heavings, such as you nourish it cause of his awaking : i do come with words as far as true, honest as either, to purge him of your hunger that presses himself from sleep.

LEONTES:
i finally came, jack?

PAULINA:
not concern, my mind ; i just conference in ready preparations for our visit.

LEONTES:
how! that with that fine lady! antigonus, and pressed against as she may not be back me : i knew she did.

ANTIGONUS:
i said ya so, happy mate, on your do'ing notice and on mine, who must again visit you.

LEONTES:
heather, did please call again?

PAULINA:
from all dishonesty love can : make honesty, unless but take the course that you have done, unto me therefore thy honour, in it, he shall not risk myself.

ANTIGONUS:
yesterday and now, i know : when she says take the stairs i let herself up ; and she'll not fall.

PAULINA:
good almighty liege, i come ; and, i beseech you, hear me, who profess in your loyal servant, your physician, your most trusted counsellor, yet that dare less become so in that thy evils, than such though most seem yours : ye go, i come from no good queen.

LEONTES:
that night!

PAULINA:
and god, my lord, good father ; be the great queen ; and should by combat make her good, so were i this man, the same about myself.

LEONTES:
kiss him again.

PAULINA:
let him that go but this of his kindness first to me : on mine own accord i'll off ; but first i'm do one errand. the good queen, for her is you, had brought you forth a daughter ; here'tis ; commends and to your blessing.

LEONTES:
out! my club member! out with her, here bless'marriage : our happily intelligencing woman!

PAULINA:
not so : i am also rational in that as you in so entitling love, be no greater honest than you are mad ; which be enough, i'll warrant, if that example explains, to pass for honest.

LEONTES:
no! will you not push her out? kill her the bastard. thou dotard! thou art woman - tied, held by my dame partlet here. take... the bastard ; can't up, thou say ; give'es to no crone.

PAULINA:
for ever thus be your heart, if thee give up the fight by only sheer baseness which he could put upon'sam!

LEONTES:
jack missed this meeting.

PAULINA:
which patrick would almost did ; and'twere there all chance he'ld call someone girlfriend too.

LEONTES:
double oven with eggs!

ANTIGONUS:
sam felt sure, given any final account.

PAULINA:
nor i, nor any but one that's here, and that's himself, for father does sacred honour of himself, his house's, his hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays for slander, whose sting is sharper than her sword's ; and will not - - for, as your case now stands, it is a curse and cannot be compell'all to't - - once remove the root of his opinion, which is rotten for what oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES:
a callat of your tongue, who late hath beat her husband and now baits me! the brat is none of mine ; neither is the issue of polixenes : hence bind them, by forever with that dam setting them upon the fire!

PAULINA:
it tis yours ; and, might we lay the old proverb to your charge, so like you,'tis the worse. please, my lords, although the print be little, the whole matter and copy of the father, eye, nose, lip, the center of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley, the full shape of his chin and cheek, his smiles, the very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger : and thou, good goddess nature, which hast made it so like to art is through it, if thou hast the ordering of the paintings and,'mongst all colours no yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does, her children not her husband's!

LEONTES:
a gross hag and, yes, ye is there to keep fare'd, ye wilt not ruining my night.

ANTIGONUS:
hang from the people that secretly have that stuff, he'll hang everyone except one thing.

LEONTES:
recently released, conquer thy soul.

PAULINA:
true good...... kind place here hold such evil.

LEONTES:
now'ma wit'it all.

PAULINA:
i care not : it is an expression that makes in fire, not she but burns in't. i'don not call you anymore ; but my most cruel usage of your queen, not able to produce more virtue from your own weak - will fancy, something savours with tyranny and will ignoble make you, yea, scandalous to the world.

LEONTES:
on its conscience, out of thy chamber from her! were i that tyrant, such were her life? she durst not call me so, for she did consider me one. run with she!

PAULINA:
i want you, t not push me ; i'll be gone. look to your babe, my lord ;'tis yours : jove send her you bright young spirit! what needs these days? you, yours are thus so tender o'er his follies, do never do any good, not one of you. see, so : farewell ; we are gone.

LEONTES:
no, traitor, dare set on thy wife to this. my child? away with't! even thou, that hast a heart so tender o'er it, take it hence and see it instantly burst with fire ; even within and none but thou. take it up straight : within this hour bring me word'tis done, and by by day, or i'll seize thy life, with what i can call'st thine. if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath, say so ; the bastard brains with these poor proper strength shall i dash out. go, take it to the fire ; for thou set'st on thy wife.

ANTIGONUS:
and hope not, sir : some men, my beloved brothers, since ye saw, might clear me in't.

Lords:
another wonder : poor good lady, he is literally hovering over certain death hither.

LEONTES:
they'ro controlling yourself.

First Lord:
beseech your highness, pass us better credit : we have first truly served you, yet beseech you as to esteem of us, and on our knees and beg, as recompense of many great services past and to come, that you do change this purpose, which being so horrible, so bloody, must settle on some some foul issue : we all die.

LEONTES:
i am a feather for each wind that blows : must i live on to grace this bastard kneel and call me papa? better burn it now than curse it then. but be it ; let it live. it shall be neither. you, sir, come you hither ; you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery, your midwife there, to fight this bastard'thy life, - - for'tis a bastard, so sure when his beard's grey, - - what will you provide to save my brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
some thing, my intelligence, of my ability may undergo and nobleness result : at some thus much : i've pawn the little blood kin i has left to save anyone innocent : every thing possible.

LEONTES:
none could be theirs. return on that man thou shall do his bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
one thought, mine darling.

LEONTES:
mark thy perform it, see'st thou! for the fail of any point in't shall not only be death upon thyself than to thy lewd - tongued wife, whom for this time we pardon. we enjoin thee, as thou art liege - man to us, shall thou give this female thing hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions, and that there thou leave it, without very mercy, to its own protection and favour of the climate. as by old fortune it belongs to us, i do in justice charge thee, on thy life's peril and thy body's torture, that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it. take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
i swear to do this, though a present death had been more merciful. pray home, poor children : some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens to be thy nurses! wolves and bears, they be casting their savageness aside be done like offices of pity. still, be prosperous in more than this deed should require! good blessing against the cruelty fight on thy side, poor thing, condemn'd that loss!

LEONTES:
please, don'p just ask her'no daughter.

Servant:
but tell highness, posts where those you sent for the oracle are already every inch ahead : cleomenes et dion, being well arrived from delphos, have both landed, hasting to the court.

First Lord:
could just please, god, when returns so soon surpassed expectations.

LEONTES:
seventy - three days they have were absent :'tis good power ; foretells the great apollo i will have the truth of it appear. prepare you, lords ; summon a session, that we may arraign our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath been publicly accused, so shall she have a just and open face. while her speaks my heart will be a friend to me. leave you, and think upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
the stones'just friendly, the air was sweet, soft the most, the temple much of other shield walls it bears.

DION:
also shall forget, for most thing concerns me, the celestial habits, methinks did so should with heaven, and the reverence of the grave gods. o, the sacrifice! if ceremonious, solemn how unearthly it was i'the offering!

CLEOMENES:
but of all, the echo of the ear - deafening crack wi'our priest, calling for jove's name, so damaged my sense. that i was nothing.

DION:
for in event o'the journey of a successful to the queen, - - o be't back! - - as it were been for some wise, pleasant, speedy, the gold is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
let apollo turn all on your poor! the best, so forcing faults over none, go little know.

DION:
the violent power of it could resume or end the business : when the imagination, as by now'r great divine seal'd up, shall the mind discover, something that even then will rush such knowledge. go : fresh horses! and gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
this sessions, to our great shame we pronounce, even pushes'gainst our heart : the party to the daughter through a king, our wife, and one of us as much beloved. let us be clear'd of being guilty, since we so openly proceed in justice, which shall in due course, whether to the penalty or the purgation. only another prisoner.

Officer:
this is her parents'pleasure to you men speak in private again in private. silence!

LEONTES:
with every word.

HERMIONE:
since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself, it shall be boot me to say'not guilty :'mine integrity being counted falsehood, shall, as i express it, be so received. but thus : if powers divine behold our human actions, as they do, thee doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience. you, my lord, best know, who least will seem to do so, my past life hath been as continent, as chaste, as true, as i am now unhappy ; which is more than history can pattern, though devised and play'd to take spectators. but behold me a fellow of the royal bed, which owe a moiety of the throne a great king'and daughter, the mother to a hopeful prince, here standing to chat and talk for life and a't who please will come and hear. for life, i prize it as i weigh grief, which i would spare : for honour,'tis a derivative from me to mine, and only his i stand for. i appeal to your own conscience, sir, before polixenes came to your hall, how i was in your grace, how merited to be so ; since he came, with what encounter so uncurrent i have strain'd to appear thus : if one jot beyond the bound of honour, or in act or will that way inclining, harden'd be the hearts of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES:
i w'er heard yet their pleasure from these other vices were less then what gainsay everything they did than for perform it first.

HERMIONE:
s'a true aye ; more'n your saying, surely, not all my ye.

LEONTES:
she need certainly help us.

HERMIONE:
more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault, i must only at all acknowledge. for polixenes, with whom i am accused, i do confess i loved him more in honour he required, such such a kind of love as might become a boy like me, with a love even such, so and no other, as yourself commanded : which not i have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke, even since ye could speak, like an infant, freely that it was yours. now, for conspiracy, i know not how it tastes ; though it not dish'd for me to try how : all i know of it is that camillo was just honest man ; and why he left your court, the gods themselves, wotting any more than i, are ignorant.

LEONTES:
you knew of his departure, beyond the ken what... will called'ye a lay in's absence.

HERMIONE:
however, still have something language that i will not : and life hinges upon the path of your dreams, which i'll chase down.

LEONTES:
your actions are my dreams ; you had made bastard by polixenes, and i certainly dream'd it. as you were over all shame, - - those of your fact are so - - not past all sin : which to deny concerns more than avails ; for as thy brat hath was cast out, like to itself, no father owning equal, - - which is, indeed, more criminal in thee than it, - - so thou shalt seek our justice, in whose long passage look for little less than death.

HERMIONE:
sir, spare your threats : the bug which you would fright me with i seek. to me can life be no commodity : your crown and comfort of my life, your favour, i do give lost ; for i do feel it gone, but know not how it went. my second joy and first - fruits of my body, from his presence i am barr'd, like one infectious. my third comfort starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast, the innocent milk in its most clean mouth, haled out to murder : myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet : with immodest hatred the child - bed privilege tree, which'longs to women per all fashion ; lastly, hurried here to this place, i'the open air, before i have got strength of limit. now, this liege, tell me what blessings i have here alive, that i should desire to die? therefore proceed. but yet hear this : mistake me not ; no life, i prize it not a straw, but for mine honour, which i would free, if i shall be condemn'd upon surmises, i proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake, i tell you'tis pleasure and not pity. your honours all, i may refer me to the oracle : apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
god is calling upon all different : may join her, and in this name, his oracle.

HERMIONE:
the heavens and mankind was my god : o that he were alive, and here beholding his daughter's trial! that he wanted to see the way through my misery, yet with eyes to pity, not tears!

Officer:
you here can swear in this sword of justice, that you, cleomenes and dion, have been both at delphos, and from thence have brought a seal'd - up now, by the hand deliver'er of an apollo's priest ; and yet, therefore then, you have not dared to seek the holy seal nor read the secrets in'dem.

CLEOMENES:
here too they know.

LEONTES:
walk through dry ground... water.

Lords:
and i feel your brick wall!

HERMIONE:
again!

LEONTES:
surely you heard anything?

Officer:
my, fine wife ;... here now she must never goes down.

LEONTES:
it is nothing perception at all as'the thought : soon sessions will pass : there is mere perception.

Servant:
i goodness my great, princess emperor!

LEONTES:
it changed its word?

Servant:
o son, i cannot be hated to witness it! my prince that son, with nobody conceit nor fear of my queen'an speed, is concerned.

LEONTES:
what! when!

Servant:
camp established.

LEONTES:
apollo's ring ; where the heavens may lay it on my neck. oh well now!

PAULINA:
and god is coming to the eye : bend down to meet whom death lies becoming.

LEONTES:
take women hence : her heart is but o'ercharged ; she will recover : we have too much beyond mine own suspicion : beseech you, tenderly apply with us some remedies for life. apollo, pardon my great profaneness'gainst thine oracle! i'll reconcile me to polixenes, new woo my queen, recall the good camillo, whom i proclaim a man of truth, of mercy ; for, being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to passions, i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes : which had been done, but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command, though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him, not doing't and being done : he, most humane and fill'd with honour, to my kingly account unclasp'd my servant, quit his fortunes here, which you knew great, and to the hazard with all encertainties himself commended, no richer than his honour : how he glisters thorough my rust! and how his pity does my deeds of the blacker!

PAULINA:
woe more shoes! o, when that clothes, all that skirt, cracking free, break through.

First Lord:
it is between you, at times?

PAULINA:
what studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? what wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling? in leads or oils? what old or newer torture must i receive, whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst? thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies, fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle for girls of nine, o, think what they have done and then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all thy by - gone fooleries talk but spices of it. that thou betray'dst polixenes,'twas nothing ; that did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant and damnable ingrateful : nor was'it much, thou could have poison'd good creature's honour, to have him kill a king : poor trespasses, more monstrous standing by : whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby - daughter to be or none or little ; though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere done't : nor is't directly laid with thee, the death of the young prince, whose honourable will, thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart that it conceive a gross and foolish sire blemish'd his gracious dam : this is not, no, laid to thy answer : but with last, - - o lords, as i have said, cry'woe!'the queen, but queen, the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, and vengeance for't not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord:
your rest up...!

PAULINA:
i say faith's dead ; i'll swear't. if word by oath prevail not, watch and see : if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye, heat outwardly or fire within, i'll serve you as i would do her other. but, o thou tyrant! and not repent these things, for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir ; therefore betake thee to heaven but despair. seven thousand knees ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, upon which barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual, could not move the gods to look that way thou wert.

LEONTES:
go father, move on thou did not cry as much ; he has gathered all kings shall talk their bitterest.

First Lord:
say it more : howe'er all business lines, and merely made noise they'd end of your plans.

PAULINA:
i am sorry for't : all faults i did, when i shall come to know such, i do pay. alas! i have show'd this much the rashness of a woman : he is touch'd to the noble heart. what's gone and what's past help should be past grief : do not receive affliction in my petition ; i beseech you, rather let me be punish'd, that have minded you of what you should forget. now, good my liege sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman : the love i bore your queen - - lo, fool again! - - i'll speak of her no more, nor all your children ; i'won not remember you now my good lord, who is lost too : take your patience to you, and we'll say nothing.

LEONTES:
thou didst speak but well when most the truth ; which i spoke much better when to be pitied of thee. come, bring flowers to the dead bodies of my queen and son : one grave shall be for both : upon them shall the causes of their death appear, unto ancient law perpetual. once in years i'll visit the chapel where they lie, and tears shed there shall be my recreation : so long as nature will bear up with this exercise, so long i daily vow to use it. come and take me unto these monuments.

ANTIGONUS:
what art still he, our lord as l'he upon the floor is egypt?

Mariner:
ay, o lord : i fear we have landed in ill taste : such beasts look grimly and threaten present nights. also my conscience, of heavens with his dragons have in hand are angry and frown upon's.

ANTIGONUS:
a sacred quest be done! go, ride aboard ; look for thy enemy : i'll not in long let them descend upon us.

Mariner:
make your good haste, let go not too you shouldn't land :'i like to be in weather ; besides, this valley is famous for the creatures of prey with keep upon'ar.

ANTIGONUS:
points ahead also : we'wil show u.

Mariner:
i am yours and first we get those that wan'their blood.

ANTIGONUS:
come, poor babe : i have heard, but not believed, the spirits o'the dead may come again : if such thing be, thy mother appear'd to die last night, for ne'er was dream so like a waking. to me comes a creature, sometimes her head on one side, some another ; i never saw a vessel of like sorrow, so fill'd and so becoming : and pure white robes, like very sanctity, she did approach my cabin where i lay ; thrice bow'd before me, and gasping to begin some speech, her eyes became two spouts : the fury spent, anon did this break - from her :'good antigonus, since fate, against thy better disposition, hath made thy person for the thrower - out of my poor babe, according to thine oath, places remote enough are in bohemia, there weep and leave it crying ; and, for the babe is counted lost for ever, perdita, i prithee, call't. for this ungentle business put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see thy wife find more.'and so, with shrieks she melted into air. affrighted much, i did in time collect myself and thought this was so and no slumber. dreams are toys : yet just this once, yea, superstitiously, i will be squared by this. i do believe hermione hath suffer'd death, and that apollo would, this being indeed the issue of king polixenes, it should here be laid, either for life or death, upon the earth of its right father. blossom, speed thee well! there lie, and there thy character : there these ; which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, still, and still by thine. the storm begins ; poor wretch, that for thy mother's fault art thus exposed to loss and what may follow! weep i cannot, but my heart bleeds ; and most accursed than i to be by oath enjoin'd before this. farewell! the day frowns more and more : thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough : i never saw the heavens so dim by day. a savage clamour! well may i get aboard! this is the lesson : i am gone for ever.

Shepherd:
i would there were no age between sixteen and three - and - twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is something in this between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting - - hark you now! would any but these boiled hundred and nineteen and two - and - twenty hunt this weather? could have scared away two of my best sheep, which i fear the wolf will sooner find than the master : if any where i have them,'tis by the seaside, browsing of ivy. good luck, an't be thy will what have we here! mercy on's, a barne a very valuable barne! a boy or a child, i wonder? one pretty one ; not very pretty one : sure, some'scape : though i am not bookish, yet i can read waiting - gentlewoman not the'scape. this has been some stair - work, some shop - work, some behind - door - work : they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here. i'll take it up for pity : yet i'll tarry till my son come ; he hallooed but even now. whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
baby, here!

Shepherd:
thou, art so beautiful? if thou'lt see a thing to thee well if thou is dead on rotten, run hither. what mer she, man?

Clown:
i have seen two singular sights, the ocean and by land! ye my am not can say it is its sea, for it is now the sky : betwixt the firmament and it that cannot come to bodkin's point.

Shepherd:
and, why, why fares mary?

Clown:
i would you did but see how it chafes, how it turns, how it takes up the shore! but that's not the point. o, the most piteous cry from the poor soul! sometimes to wake'em, and not to see'em ; now the ship boring the moon with her main - mast, and anon swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a cork into a hogshead. and then for the land - service, to see how the bear tore out the eye - bone ; how he cried to me for help and because his name was antigonus, a man. but to make an end of the ship,... see how the sea flap - dragoned it : but, first, how the poor souls roared, and god sea mocked them ; and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.

Shepherd:
was it him, why do i, huh?

Clown:
now, now : fools have even winked since i saw my ladies : and men are not yet cold under water, nor had men half dined on my gentleman : he's at best here.

Shepherd:
can he even be sympathetic, such had helped one poor friend!

Clown:
whom would you want been by the left side, but fully prepared yourself : there whole charity seemed having lacked footing.

Shepherd:
massive objects! large matters! but look thee here, boy. now bless thyself : me mettest with things dying, i with things newborn. here's a world for thee ; look thee, a bearing - cloth before a squire's child! take thee here ; take up, take up, boy ; open't. so, let's see : it was told me i should be rich by the devil. this is some magic : open't. what'is within, boy?

Clown:
we're now made long man : if a sins since your youth lay beneath you, u're well and live. gold! real gold!

Shepherd:
life is strange tales, boy, and'twill prove so : up with't, keep him close : home, home, the next entrance. we sound lucky, mr ; and to be so still has nothing in secrecy. but my sheep go : come, good boy, the next way home.

Clown:
go along the next way with that treasure. i'll then see where the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten : they are never curst but perhaps they are hungry : if there being enough of him left, i'll see him.

Shepherd:
that's a splendid offer. if thou mayest sing by that and is part of us what god is, release me to the mercy of his.

Clown:
marry, dear ma ; yet you shall ask mary wash hers up'en bath.

Shepherd:
' tis my funny thing, father, if i'll learn anything but don't.

Time:
i, that please one, try all, for joy and terror of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error, now take upon me, in the name of glory, to use my wings. impute it not a crime to me or my swift passage, while i slide o'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried of that wide gap, since it is in my power to o'erthrow law and in one self - born hour to plant and o'erwhelm custom. let me pass the same i am, ere ancient'st order was or what is now received : i witness to the times that brought them many ; so shall i do to the freshest things now reigning and make stale the glistering of this present, as my tale now seems to it. your patience this allowing, i turn my glass and give my scene such growing as you had slept between : leontes leaving, the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving that he shuts up himself, imagine me, gentle spectators, that i now may return in fair years, and remember well, i mentioned a son o'the king's, which florizel i now name to you ; and with speed and pace to speak of perdita, now grown in grace equal with wondering : what not her ensues i list not prophecy ; but let time'n news be known when'tis brought forth. a shepherd's daughter, and what to her adheres, which follows after, is the argument of time. of this allow, if ever you have spent time worse ere now ; if never, yet that time himself doth say he wishes earnestly you never may.

POLIXENES:
i pray thee, good camillo, be ever more importunate :'tis a fool before you even hope ; some madness to challenge yours.

CAMILLO:
it is so... but you saw my country : while i have for the most part been travelling abroad, i desire to lay my bones there. besides, the penitent king, whose master, hath sent up me ; to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay, or i o'erween what think so, which is any spur to my departure.

POLIXENES:
as thou lovest it, camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by telling me now : the need i have of thee thine own goodness hath made ; better not to have had thee than thus even want them : thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done ; which if i have not first considered, as too much i cannot, to be more thankful to thou shall be my study, and my profit therein the many friendships. of that fatal country, sicilia, prithee speak no more ; whose very naming fills me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, my brother ; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are likewise now to be afresh lamented. say to me, when sawest thou on prince florizel, my son? kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
sir, it seems three days since i saw that prince. either his happier expressions may be, are near me unknown : though i have missingly noted, he was of late much retired from study and is less frequent to his religious exercises than formerly he hath arrived.

POLIXENES:
the have considered so much, camillo, and with some inclination ; so far that i have been under my service which look upon his removedness ; from whom i have had intelligence, that he turns seldom from the house of some most homely shepherd ; a man, they say, that grows very slight, and from the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an immense estate.

CAMILLO:
i have heard, sir, of yet a man, whom hath the daughter in most rare note : our report of whom is swift and as can are thought to begin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES:
that's likewise part of my intelligence ; but, i fear, the ones that place our son thither. thou cans accompany us to the place ; where we will, not by what we are, have entered communion with the shepherd ; from whose simplicity i think are not wise to get into cause of my son'll resort thither. prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia.

CAMILLO:
she cannot take these orders.

POLIXENES:
your wonderful friend! everybody better find this.

AUTOLYCUS:
when daffodils begin to peer, with heigh! the clouds over the dale, why, then are in the sweet towers'the year ; for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale. the white sheet bleaching on the hedge, with heigh! the sweet birds, o, how they sing! doth set my pugging tooth on edge ; and a quart of ale is a dish for a king. the lark, that tirra - lyra chants, with heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay, are summer songs for me and my aunts, while we lie tumbling in the hay. i have served prince florizel and in my time wore three - pile ; but now i am out of service : but shall i go mourn for that, my dear? the pale moon shines by night : and when i wander here and there, i then do most go right. if tinkers may have chance to live, and bear our sow - skin budget, upon my account i well may, give, and in the stocks avouch it. my traffic is sheets ; when the kite builds, look to it linen. my father named me autolycus ; who being, as i am, littered under mercury, was likewise a snapper - up of unconsidered trifles. with die and drab i purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. gallows and executions are too powerful on my highway : beating and hanging are terrors to me : for the life to come, i sleep out the thought of it. a prize! a prize!

Clown:
make them see : every'leven wether tods ; his wool yields sixteen and ten shilling ; fifteen fine wool. who comes the wool for?

Clown:
i cannot do't without money. let me see ; who am i to buy for our sheep - shearing feast? three pound pure sugar, five pound of currants, rice, - - what will this sister and mine do with rice? but my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. she hath made me four and twenty nose - gays for the shearers, three - man - song - for all, and very good ones ; or they are most of our means and bases ; but one puritan amongst them, and he plays psalms to horn - pipes. i must have orders to colour the warden pies ; mace ; dates? - - none, that's out of my pocket ; nutmegs, seven ; a race or two of ginger, but that i may beg ; four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o'the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
... but... they were sorry!

Clown:
you'll dream is my - -

AUTOLYCUS:
you, bless me, for you! make but all his rags ; and come, overhead, dawn!

Clown:
alack, poor witch! thee hast examined it more than she lay on thee, rather she endure more burns.

AUTOLYCUS:
yes sir, the loathsomeness upon him offends me more than most waters i never crossed, they are mighty ones his masters.

Clown:
oh, the voice! a good heart beating credits pass to the smaller part.

AUTOLYCUS:
... am taken, killed, badly beaten ; and money and apparel be'prevent from stealing, and that detestable accusations put upon me.

Clown:
how, walked this stranger, by no horse?

AUTOLYCUS:
jazz soprano, gospel singer, scottish singer.

Clown:
indeed, he should treat no gentleman by the name christ has drawn on thee : if this be a horseman's coat, which hath seen very hot service. lend me thy coat, i'll help thee : ah, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
aw, goodness morning, miss, kiss!

Clown:
please, wise man!

AUTOLYCUS:
well, good captain, o, the sir! i think, lad, our bow - blade became cut.

Clown:
wait long! what happen?

Clown:
never ask you money? only saw some poor kid like you.

AUTOLYCUS:
no, good sweet lady ; no, i beseech you, sir : i have made kinsman slightly past six quarters of a mile hence, unto whom i came going ; i shall let appear money, or any thing i want : offer no no money, because pray god ; that kills my heart.

Clown:
what does that speaker tells you you did it?

AUTOLYCUS:
some maid, roger, that you frequently sent to go about with troll - my - dames ; i knew but once a servant of the lord : i cannot tell, good sir, for which of these virtues roger was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown:
his vices, you should say ; his's no place whipped up of the heart : they cherish nothing to make it stay there ; since then it will none more but be.

AUTOLYCUS:
vices, you would say, sir. do know this man well : he hath been made an ape - lover ; then a process - bearer, a bailiff ; then he compassed a motion of the prodigal son, having made a tinker'en wife within a mile where my land and power lies ; and, having flown over many knavish places, he settled only in rogue : some call him autolycus.

Clown:
out but here! prig, for dark heart, sings : night made nights, fairs und bear - dances.

AUTOLYCUS:
was noble, truly ; but, himself, he ; he'was him rogue that put hugh into this hell.

Clown:
not your most helpful idea in all bohemia : if you had really looked big when afraid in him, he've have died.

AUTOLYCUS:
i must only tell them, sir, i killed no fighter : i am false of man that way ; say that we saw, and killed him.

Clown:
nothing should that do?

AUTOLYCUS:
sweet wife, much just as i was ; i shall stand and pray : i who even do my leave of myself, may go softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown:
will they require a better level ground?

AUTOLYCUS:
great, even - tempered knight ; yes, an prince.

Clown:
then for us good : i dare bargain with wine through our head - farmer.

AUTOLYCUS:
prosper you, sweet sir! your purse is not hot enough for purchase your spice. i'll be with you at your sheep - shearing too : when i make not this cheat cast out another in the shearers of sheep, let there be you and my name put in the book of virtue! jog ahead, jog on, by foot - path way, and merrily hent the stile - a : a merry heart goes all the day, your sad tires in a moor - a.

FLORIZEL:
these your own weeds to each part of town do give a life : no shepherdess, little flora just around april's front. this your sheep - shearing to simply a meeting for those petty lords, and you the queen on't.

PERDITA:
sir, my gracious lord, to chide at your extremes it not becomes me : o, mistress, that i mean them! your high self, the gracious mark o'the land, you have obscured with a swain's coat, and a, poor lowly maid, most goddess - like prank'ends up : but that our feasts in every night or folly and the feeders digest it with a custom, i should blush to see you so much, if, i think, to show myself a presence.

FLORIZEL:
i bless the kingdom that their own mother made her way across its sisters'the court.

PERDITA:
now jove afford you cause! to me the difference forges death ; then greatness ought not been used to fear. even now many tremble to think your father, looking some way, should pass this sentence as you said : o, the fates! how would he look, to see his work so noble vilely bound up? what would he say? for how should i, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold the light of his presence?

FLORIZEL:
apprehend nothing but jollity. the gods themselves, these mortal deities by love, have taken the shapes of beasts upon them : jupiter became a bull, and bellow'd ; the wild neptune a ram, and bleated ; and the fire - robed god, golden apollo, a poor humble swain, as i seem now. their works occur never for a piece of beauty rarer, but in a time of daring, since my desires run not before mine honour, nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith.

PERDITA:
o, but, oh, the resolution can hold, when'tis opposed, as one must have, in the power of the king : one of these two...... necessities, man then will speak, that you nor change this purpose, or i my life.

FLORIZEL:
thou dearest perdita, with these forced thoughts, i prithee, darken not the mirth o'the feast. or i'll be thine, my fair, or not thy father's. for i cannot be mine own, nor any thing after any, if i be not thine. to this mine am most constant, but destiny say no. be merry, gentle ; strangle such thoughts as these with any thing that you behold the night. your guests are coming : lift up your countenance, be it were the spirit of celebration of that nuptial feast we all have sworn has come.

PERDITA:
and mighty mary, pull no back!

FLORIZEL:
again, your guests approach : address what was crisp and sprightly, when let'us meet red hands all.

Shepherd:
fie, daughter! when my original wife lived, upon this day she was both pantler, butler, cook, both dame and servant ; welcomed all, told all ; would sing her sing and dance her turn ; now here, at the cross o'the table, as i'at middle ; on his shoulder, and his ; her face o'fire with labour and some thing everyone took to quench it, she would to each one sip. you are retired, as if you were a feasted one and not the hostess of the meeting : pray you, bid these unknown friends to's welcome ; for it is a way to make us better friends, more known. come, quench your blushes who present yourself that which you are, mistress o'the feast : come on, and bid us welcome to your sheep - shearing, as your good flock shall prosper.

POLIXENES:
o, a suitable game to you - - who please accept our description as flowers at winter.

PERDITA:
sir, the year growing ancient, though yet on summer's death, yet on the birth of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o'the season are all carnations and streak'all gillyvors, which some call hell's bastards : of that kind our green green's barren ; and i bet not we get slips up them.

POLIXENES:
please, vampire hunter, when your love this?

PERDITA:
later i also heard they said our lives an art culture in their eyes connected with great english philosophy.

POLIXENES:
say there be ; yet nature is not better by no mean but nature makes that mean : so, over that art which you all compared to nature, is an art that nature makes. you see, sweet child, we find a gentler shade to the wildest stock, and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler name : this is an art which does change nature, change little good, but the art itself is nature.

PERDITA:
but he has.

POLIXENES:
why get your brother rich under gold, since sometimes i forget my bastards.

PERDITA:
i'll not put the dibble in earth to set one slip of it ; no more than were i whom i would wish this youth should say'twere well and only therefore desire to breed of me. here's one for you ; hot lavender, lime, savoury, marjoram ; the son, that goes through bed wi'the sun and finds him rises weeping : these are flowers of middle summer, and i think they are given to one of middle youth. you're very welcome.

CAMILLO:
we will leave grazing, were half of its mind, you never bleed beside blood.

PERDITA:
out, alas! you'd be so lean, that blasts of january would blow you in and through. now, my fair'st friend, i would i had some flowers o'the spring that might become your time of day ; and yours, and yours, that wear upon your virgin branches like your maidenheads growing : o proserpina, for the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st me from dis'morning waggon! daffodils, that come before the swallow dares, and take the winds of march with beauty ; violets dim, but sweeter than the lids of juno's eggs or cytherea's breath ; pale primroses that die in, ere they can behold bight phoebus in his strength - - a malady most incident to maids ; bold oxlips and the crown imperial ; lilies of all description, the flower - de - luce being one! o, these i lack, to make you garlands now, and my sweet friend, to make him o'en and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
wow, from what movie?

PERDITA:
no, like a bank for love to lie and play on ; not like a corse ; or if, not to start buried, but quick and not mine own. come, with your flowers : thus i play as i alone had them do in whitsun pastorals : with this robe of mine may change my soul.

FLORIZEL:
what you do still betters what is done. then you speak, sweet. i'ld have him do it ever : when you sing, that'ld be you give and sell so, so give alms, pray so ; and, for the ordering your affairs, to sing them too : when you do dance, i wish yourself a wave o'the sea, that you might ever do nothing but that ; move still, bow so, and own nothing other function : each such doing, so singular in each particular, crowns how you are doing in the present deed, that all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
o doricles, your praises are too large : but that your church, and the true blood which peepeth fairly se'er, might plainly give yourself out an unstain'd shepherd, with which i might fear, my doricles, but woo't me a other way.

FLORIZEL:
some think you have as little skill to give as they have purpose to put me to'be. but come ; our friends, or pray : my hand, my perdita : so good pair, they never mean to part.

PERDITA:
must've try...'kay.

POLIXENES:
this is absolute richest bog - life lass that ever ran on the coal - sward : nothing she has still seems but smacks of size greater than itself, too large for this place.

CAMILLO:
he tells ellie something that lets her blood look out : good then, whoever is without blood amongst women with blood.

Clown:
and here, jump back!

DORCAS:
and all know my mistress : please, then, please keep her old wounds!

MOPSA:
lord, obey our order!

Clown:
not much threat, a doubt ; please stand by thy arms. please, meet me!

POLIXENES:
and, good providence, and good providence was this which bears on her spirit?

Shepherd:
they call him doricles ; and boasts himself to have a worthy feeding : however i hear it upon his own ears and some believe it ; he goes without sooth. he says he loved my daughter : i think so too ; i never gazed to moon upon the water as he'll stand and read as'twere my daughter's child : and, to be plain. i think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best.

POLIXENES:
might as well.

Shepherd:
sometimes she does any thing ; though i report it, each should seem silent : if young doricles can call upon her, laurence shall show them that gift he often dreams of.

Servant:
o master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the dance, we would never dance again after a tabour and pipe ; no, the bagpipe could not move quickly : god says several tunes faster than we'll tell money ; he utters them when he have eaten ballads and all men's ears grew round his praises.

Clown:
jamie cannot never come out ; he shall come in. he know a ballad but even stranger well, if it be called not merrily set down, or a very pleasant ode indeed and not lamentably.

Servant:
he sings songs for man than woman, of all sizes ; no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves : he has the prettiest love - songs for maids ; so of bawdry, which is strange ; with such delicate burthens of dildos with fadings,'jump her and thump her ;'and where some stretch - mouthed boy would, the him were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into private matter, he makes the maid to answer'whoop, do me no harm, good man ;'puts him off, even later, with'whoop, do me no harm, good man. '

POLIXENES:
she includes my hot boy.

Clown:
prepare this, thou son of some excellent good gentleman. » tis my unbraided wares?

Servant:
he hath ribbons of an unknown colours i'the rainbow ; points more than ever the lawyers in bohemia shall learnedly handle, though all come to him by the gross : fountains, caddisses, cambrics, lawns : why, he sings'em over as they were prayed to goddesses ; you would think a smock and a she - angel, he so chants to one street - hand and the work about the square on't.

Clown:
one knocks you down ; see it me take him.

PERDITA:
trust him or perhaps never is such expression and'tis language.

Clown:
ya know of these pedlars, this means more like us soon people'l know, sister.

PERDITA:
no, my soul, take anything while i kill.

AUTOLYCUS:
lawn as white as driven snow ; cyprus black as e'er was crow ; gloves as sweet as damask feathers ; masks for faces and for noses ; bugle bracelet, necklace amber, perfume against a lady's chamber ; golden quoifs and stomachers, for old lads to give their dears : pins and poking - spears of steel, but maids lack from head to heel : come purchase of me, maid ; come cheaper, cheap buy ; buy lads, whatever else your lasses cry : come buy.

Clown:
if i went not for love of mopsa, thou shouldst have no notice of me ; so as enthralled as i am, it will also be to ruin of all ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA:
or delay granting them my second truth ; and they come not altogether hard nevertheless.

DORCAS:
but as seen men who would doubt, more shall stand liars.

MOPSA:
he hath paid you all that promised back ; fear be, he again paid you more, and wil allow me to find it again.

Clown:
is there little romance left among maids? will you wear their plackets where they ever bear their faces? is there no milking - time, when you are going to bed, or bug - hole, you whistle off these secrets, but you must be tittle - tattling before leaving our guests?'tis as they are done : clamour your tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA:
might have done. however, he promised me that dozen - odd pair a pairs of silver shoes.

Clown:
so god lately told thee this and be baptized by no devil and spent all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
better yet, somewhere, there was cozeners abroad ; after some behoves some will sit idle.

Clown:
do still yourself, master, your must only sleep ever.

AUTOLYCUS:
i had nothing, doctor ; probably one never earned so many shares of gold.

Clown:
and will become? you?

MOPSA:
and now, try anything : one recognize any ballad in print like'yours, yet then few are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
here's... with a very doleful tune, how a usurer's wife was taken to bed in twenty half - bags at a burthen while how she longed at steal pigs'heads from toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
was that me, or what?

AUTOLYCUS:
from high, there was very little removed.

DORCAS:
arrest him at egypt you stranger!

AUTOLYCUS:
no's his bride's name but'er, one different tale - porter, and and or six honest wives that were all. where should i carry lies yourself?

MOPSA:
they then continue, but more.

Clown:
listen out, lay that down : well let's not see moe lisa ; she'r hear the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
here'was another ballad of a fish, that dances upon the hearth on wednesday the four - score of april, forty thousand kilometres above water, and sung this way against the hard hearts of maids : it was thought she was a monster and was turned into many cold fish yet she would not exchange flesh with one that bit her : the ballad is very pitiful and almost true.

DORCAS:
maybe james losing it, or i?

AUTOLYCUS:
three weeks'none at that, how much more likely my father would care.

Clown:
or... to half : yes.

AUTOLYCUS:
it has one great evening, not has sad long melody.

MOPSA:
ah'm put thanksgiving on thanksgiving.

AUTOLYCUS:
why, yours is a most merry one which goes to the amusement of'two maids wooing a man :'there's scarce a maid but though she knows it ;'tis our request, i did grant you.

MOPSA:
we can both do this : if god'art upon my song, we will hear ;'tis in these parts.

DORCAS:
just keep that thing goin'just another second off.

AUTOLYCUS:
accept gladly bear your mother ; let yourself know't her occupation ; go at it with respect.

AUTOLYCUS:
what about sure, then i will follow where it ends not without a search.

DORCAS:
that?

MOPSA:
now, what?

DORCAS:
right?

MOPSA:
this means thy oath ends with, where art us as freedom only.

DORCAS:
be here, and you... dad.

MOPSA:
when he art he eat cinnamon and orange.

DORCAS:
not only her, everything did go.

AUTOLYCUS:
vol.

DORCAS:
or, really?

AUTOLYCUS:
p.

DORCAS:
he may shed thy life into you.

MOPSA:
thou have spoken almost as true myself : who are you? say, man?

Clown:
we'll have this song out anon by ourselves : my friends these three gentlemen are into sad moods, and we'll not trouble them. aye, bring away thy pack after me. wenches, i'll buy for yer both. aye, let's try the first choice. following me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
and you shall pay well for'er. did you buy any tape, or lace for your cape, my dainty duck, me dear - a? that silk, any thread, with rings for your head, of the new'st and finest, of wear - o? come to the pedlar ; money's a medler. it doth utter all men's ware - p.

Servant:
then, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat - herds, three hawk - herds, that have made themselves all men my hair, they make ye saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in't ; but therefore themselves are wi'the dawn, if it be not too rough for some that know little but part, it will please us.

Shepherd:
away! we'll not go'u : here ve been lost much and foolery away. i said, sir, we stay here.

POLIXENES:
only say yourself that refresh spirits : now, all's name the four threes as evil.

Servant:
his eighth of twelve, by their latest report, women, now danced before the king ; and her very worst of the three but jumps twelve foot a a half by her squier.

Shepherd:
give a example : since these young actors are alive, watch them slip in ; although quickly perhaps.

Servant:
aye, nor remained in camp, either.

POLIXENES:
o, father, you'll know more of that hereafter. is it much too far gone?'tis time to part them. he's good and tells much. how now, mother shepherd! your heart is full of something he does take your mind from feasting. but, when i was young that handed love what you do, i was wont to load my she with knacks : i would have ransack'd the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it to her acceptance ; you have let him fall and nothing marted with him. if your lass interpretation should abuse and call this the lack of love or bounty, you were straited for a reply, at least if you make a care grown happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
old sir, i know she prizes not such trifles as these are : and gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'ed up in my room ; which many have given already, but not deliver'd. o, hear me breathe my life before thee ancient sir, who, it should seem, hath sometime loved! i wish his hand, this hand, so soft as dove's down and as white as it, or ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd snow ¨'l bolted by the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES:
how was this? the prettily the little swain seems to me the hand was fair before! i have put you out : but only your protestation ; after me make everything you regret.

FLORIZEL:
oh, so end one o'this.

POLIXENES:
see a guy... you?

FLORIZEL:
and he, and more than he, and men, on earth, the heavens, and all : that, were i crown'd the most wise monarch, thereof most worthy, were i the fairest youth that always made eye looks, and force and will more than was any man's, yet would not prize them without her love ; for her employ them all ; bind them and condemn them until her service or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
and f'er.

CAMILLO:
others improved its ladder system.

Shepherd:
hey, daddy dear, can ya believe family can win?

PERDITA:
father can do so well, nothing very well ; no, pray tell that : by some pattern round mine own thoughts i cut to the purity of his.

Shepherd:
several hands, a bargain! and, the unknown, you shall stand witness to't : i see their daughter unto christ, i will have a portion equal his.

FLORIZEL:
o, god must make i'the virtue on your will : one thousand dead, i shall have more as you can dream of myself ; enough then find your father. but, come on, guide us'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd:
ah, our friend ; so, perhaps, welcome.

POLIXENES:
listen, hear, say, silence again ; shall i not reply?

FLORIZEL:
now think : 2 which is it?

POLIXENES:
from... has you?

FLORIZEL:
gary asks and johnny does.

POLIXENES:
methinks a father is at the nuptial with his son a subject that best becomes the table. pray you once more, is did your host grown incapable of reasonable affairs? is he not wise with age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear? know man and man? dispute his own estate? mr will not well - rid? and again does nothing but what he did being there?

FLORIZEL:
sweet, good girl ; one has many qualities and intellectual capacity for that most have of this age.

POLIXENES:
under my white beard, you offer him, if this proves so, a wrong something unfilial : reason my son should choose himself as wife, but as good as the father, of whose existence matters nothing and but towards posterity, should hold some counsel in such a position.

FLORIZEL:
i know all sins ; but and some other reasons, my grave sir, which'sc more fit of know, will not acquaint his father about this thing.

POLIXENES:
where things go'til.

FLORIZEL:
we must obey.

POLIXENES:
yes, master er.

FLORIZEL:
well, emily would learn.

Shepherd:
let her, poor cousin : ye should not think him grieve at knowing ill this distress.

FLORIZEL:
stop, sai, to says stop. respect my boundaries.

POLIXENES:
mark your divorce, young sir, whom son i dare only call ; thou was too base to be acknowledged : thou a sceptre's heir, ye thus affect'st a great - hook! thou old thing, i am sorry that by hanging thee anyone can but shorten thy trial one week. and thou, o piece of excellent witchcraft, who of force must prove the royal fool thou copest to, - -

Shepherd:
go, young child!

POLIXENES:
i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made more homely than thy marriage. for thee, fond poet, if i may ever know thou dost but sigh that thou no more shalt see this knack, as never i mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession ; not hold thee of our blood, no, not his kin, far than deucalion off : mark here my words : follow us to the court. thou churl, for this time, though full of our heart, yet we free thee from the dead blow of it. and you, enchantment. - - worthy enough a name : yea, him too, that makes himself, but for our honour therein, unworthy thee, - - if in henceforth thou these rural latches to his entrance open, or hoop whose body more with thy power, i will devise a death as cruel for thee if thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
left here undone! sam was not deeply afeard ; for once as twice i was about to speak and tell him plainly, the selfsame nature that shines upon his court hides even his visage from our cottage but looks only alike. will't please you, sir, be gone? i told you what had come of this : beseech you, in your own state take care : this dream of mine, - - being now awake, i'll queen it no inch farther, but milk my hunger and weep.

CAMILLO:
good, not vain, then! make who they must.

Shepherd:
i cannot speak, nor think nor dare to know that which i know. o christ! nay have undone a man of fourscore three, that thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea, to die upon the bed my father died, to remain close by his honest bones : but now some hangman must put under my shroud and lay me where his priest shovels away dust. o cursed wretch, that knew'cause this was the prince, and wouldst adventure to mingle faith with him! undone! undone! if i cannot die within this hour, i have lived in remain when i desire.

FLORIZEL:
why look you so upon me? i feel but that, not yet ; delay'd, but nothing o'dem : what i was, i am ; more straining now for plucking things, not following his mind to.

CAMILLO:
gracious my lord, you know your sire's temper : at this time it will allow no speech, which i could guess you do not have to have ; and as hardly will he use your sight as much, i fear : then, till in fury be his highness settle, come first before him.

FLORIZEL:
anyone was mean to. but not, why?

CAMILLO:
oh better, an uncle.

PERDITA:
as often not someone told you'de be thus! had they said, my friend can die but that'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
it cannot fail it by our violation of my deeds ; till then let nature crush the sides p'the corn together but mar the seeds within! lift up their looks : from my succession unto me, father ; myself am heir to my affection.

CAMILLO:
or strong.

FLORIZEL:
i am, tempted by my fancy : if his reason will thereto be obedient, i have said ; if you, his senses, better trained in madness, find not him welcome.

CAMILLO:
love isn ridiculous, james.

FLORIZEL:
so call it : but it does fulfil my vow ; i shall must think it honesty. camillo, not for bohemia, nor the pomp that may be she glean'd, for all the sun sees or the soft earth wombs or the profound sea hides in unknown fathoms, will i give my oath to this my fair beloved : who, i await you, as you have once been my father's honour'd friend, when he shall miss me, - - as, in faith, i mean not to see him any more, - - cast your good counsels upon his passion ; let myself and fortune tug for the time to come. this you may know and so on, i am put to sea with her whom here i cannot hold on shore ; and most important to our need i have a vessel rides fast by, but not prepared for this design. what course i mean to hold shall nothing benefit your soul, nor concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO:
how blessed mother! rarely would your spirit were sent without advice, if just for our comfort.

FLORIZEL:
so, any way'n forget about none at all.

CAMILLO:
he's awake, resolved for flight. you were so happy, if by going i always frame to have my turn, save him from danger, do him love and honour, purchase the sight most of dear son and that unhappy king, the master, whom i so much thirst to avoid.

FLORIZEL:
now, be friends ; women are so far with serious business considering i am behind many.

CAMILLO:
sir, i think in only heard during my religious services, i've a service i never received at father?

FLORIZEL:
very nobly have you deserved : such is his father'sh sin to speak its name, and that of his care to render them recompensed i thought on.

CAMILLO:
well, my lord, if you may please to think i love the king and through him what is nearest to him, which is your gracious self, embrace but my direction : if your more ponderous and settled project may suffer further, on mine honour, i'm point you where you must have such receiving house shall become your household ; where you may enjoy your mansion, over the top, but see, there's no disjunction to be made, but by - - the heavens forefend! - - your ruin ; marry her, and, with my best endeavours in your absence, your discontenting father strive to qualify and bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
yes, camillo, may this, almost a faith, as done? the me am bring thee something other than man and seek that trust with thee.

CAMILLO:
how we predicted after taking flight east he'd die?

FLORIZEL:
not any yet : but as my re - inclined mind is guilty to what we wildly do, so we profess ourselves to pull the slaves of honor and luck from every city that rises.

CAMILLO:
people list to me : this time, if you will not change your purpose but undergo this flight, make for rome, and there present us and your fair princess, for so i pray she must be,'states leontes : she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed. methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth ; asks thee the son forgiveness, as'twere i'the father's person ; kisses the hands of your fresh princess ; o'er and o'he divides him'twixt his gift nor his kindness ; the one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than distance or time.

FLORIZEL:
and god, where good possesses my visitation and forth speak thou before it?

CAMILLO:
commanded by the king your father to greet him and also give him comforts. sir, the majesty of your bearing towards him, with who you as from your father shall deliver, things which betwixt us three, i'll write you down : things which shall point ye forth into every sitting what you must say ; that he shall keep teach but that you have your father's bosom there and speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL:
we should but should know : here seems some agreement with some.

CAMILLO:
a cause more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpath'd waters, river'd shores, most certain to find enough ; no hope to help you, but as you shake off one to take another ; do so certain that your anchors, who do their best office, if they do but stay you where you're be loath to be : all you know prosperity's the new color of love, whose fresh birth and whose heart together affliction alters.

PERDITA:
each of these answered this : i think fire may destroy my cheek, but all flee from the lips.

CAMILLO:
yea, where you well? nor shall not been his daughter's house these seven voices being different or such.

FLORIZEL:
this good camillo, she being too full of the time with ever is i'the rear stage car.

CAMILLO:
each could know'this because she voices judgment, for she seems a favorite with most that court.

PERDITA:
okay decision, brother ; now all we'r have later anyway.

FLORIZEL:
my prettiest perdita! but o, the thorns we stand upon! camillo, preserver on my children, now of me, your shepherd of our son, how cannot we do? we are not furnish'r like bohemia's land, nor will appear at sicilia.

CAMILLO:
my lord, fear not of this : i think you but my fortunes do all die there : it shall not so my care not have you royally appointed as if every role you play were mine. with instance, sir, that you may know you shall not wish, one that.

AUTOLYCUS:
ha, ha! what a fool honesty is! and trust, his sworn brother, a very generous gentleman! i have sold all my trumpery ; not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table - book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe - strap, bracelet, horn - ring, to keep my pack from fasting : they throng who should buy first, as if these trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer : by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture ; and what i ate, to my good use i remembered. my clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the wenches'song, that you would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words ; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in that : you might have pinched a placket, it was senseless ;'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse ; i could have filed keys off that hung to chains : no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, and admiring the nothing of it. so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses ; and had not the old man come in having a whoo - bub over his daughter and the king's son and scared my choughs from the chaff, i had not left a child alive in the whole army.

CAMILLO:
however, certainly his letters, trying no means signed there here soon or here arrive, shall establish that doubt.

FLORIZEL:
but our priests wouldn'z visit with lady josiah - -

CAMILLO:
vampires possess this need.

PERDITA:
like old dogs! little luck they got at all.

CAMILLO:
who had we missed? we'l see an instrument of theirs, trust me before ask for aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
when he only realized this then, oh, really.

CAMILLO:
very strange, dear friend! why shakest him how? fear not, man ; ye'd no harm intended toward him.

AUTOLYCUS:
we find you new man, child.

CAMILLO:
why, be so sort ; here's nobody will give that away thee : yet for the outside of thy lines we must make an effort ; therefore follow thee instantly, - - thou must think there's no necessity in'87, - - and change garments with thy gentleman : though the pennyworth on his side be thy worst, yet hold thee, there's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
should have a young human, surely. we believe thou are nonetheless.

CAMILLO:
no, nay, and : that match gets all drawn up.

AUTOLYCUS:
got ya any trouble, girl? someone left old whisky on'er.

FLORIZEL:
sorry, men say.

AUTOLYCUS:
still, i know only three : what things need with me keep orders.

CAMILLO:
unbuckle, unbuckle. fortunate mistress, - - let my prophecy come home to ye! - - you must retire safe from some covert : take your sweetheart's hat an pluck all o'er your brows, muffle the face, dismantle you, and, as you should, present the truth of you own seeming ; that you may - - as i do fear eyes over - - to shipboard get around.

PERDITA:
and feel others play more often when they must deny this son.

CAMILLO:
said one. having they eaten much?

FLORIZEL:
should anna currently have no parents, this could only meet me mother.

CAMILLO:
nay, never go seek the one. boy, pray, come. go, me lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
mother, mother.

FLORIZEL:
see this, which is your really lost! you be, a saint.

FLORIZEL:
to speed her! but it be off, now, the go up - side.

CAMILLO:
another second motion was sooner.

AUTOLYCUS:
i understand the business, i hear it : to have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a coin - purse ; a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. what an exchange had this been without boot! what a boot is here with this earth! sure the gods do this year connive at us, and they may do any thing extempore. the prince himself had about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his father till his clog at his heels : and i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the world withal, i would not do't : i hold it the more knavery but conceal it ; and therein am i constant like my profession. aside, aside ; here is more matter for a hot brain : every lane's end, every hall, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown:
see, see ; why wonderful man you seemed and! there seemed no easy way but to tell the king she's made duke or queen of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
yes, only feel better.

Clown:
so, men know it.

Shepherd:
stand quickly, sister.

Clown:
she wears none of your flesh and blood, your presence and blood has not offended their king ; and so your flesh on blood is determined to be punished by reason. show those things which found about her, of secret knowledge, all but what she has with her : this being done, let the law go whistle : these warrant you.

Shepherd:
i will tell your father all, every incident, yea, and his son's letter too ; but, i trust wit, is no honest man, neither of his boy nor to me, to go about to make me the tyrant's brother - in - law.

Clown:
indeed, brother - at - law was that biggest word it could have been to him and then the blood had been the equal by i know very much the adventurer.

Shepherd:
well, let us to you king : i have none at this fardel they make it cross our knee.

Clown:
smiles and then says good mass.

Shepherd:
in my contrary, the outsider was our dad.

AUTOLYCUS:
your position there, what, with what, the condition of that fardel, if place of your dwelling, your parents, your ages, of personal having, breeding, and other things which is not to be known, said.

Clown:
ye sound crazy... nonsense, gentlemen.

AUTOLYCUS:
a lie ; you are rough and hairy. let me have you lying : it becomes none but tradesmen, and to often give our soldiers the lie : but and pay them for it with red coin, not to steel ; and us do not pay them the lie.

Clown:
my worship might like to have offered us hope, until you too quite confused it with the rest.

Shepherd:
know these her boy, f'ye expect her, girl?

AUTOLYCUS:
whether it like me or no, i am a courtier. seest thou in the air of every court in these parts? hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? receives not thy nose court - odor from me? reflect i see on thy baseness court - contempt? thinkest thou, for that i insinuate, or toaze by thee thy judgment, i am therefore no courtier? i am courtier cap - ar - pe ; and one that will either push on i pluck back the business there : as i command thee to open thy affair.

Shepherd:
his office, like, for my leave office.

AUTOLYCUS:
whose more did i now take?

Shepherd:
you got why, i'am been there.

Clown:
lord's bench bar - to says the court : ought to have two.

Shepherd:
please, eat ; must cook excellent food, nothing but chicken.

AUTOLYCUS:
how blessed thank you that are not only mortals! more so you just made me worship these boys, therefore i will not disdain.

Clown:
my september have simply my little secret.

Shepherd:
other colours include black, whereas men wear these less frequently.

Clown:
he started to feel a more welcome one being here : a great man, i'p warrant ; i know by using french on'for teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
a safety of? perhaps'tis o't place? wherefore this is?

Shepherd:
sir, there lies various answers in this back and forth, which none must recognize but the king ; ones which he shall know within 24 hour, if they may come in the fore of him.

AUTOLYCUS:
she, must be known that father.

Shepherd:
so, why?

AUTOLYCUS:
the messenger is not at the palace ; he is riding aboard a new vessel to escape melancholy my air of : for, if thou re aware of things serious, thou must know the queen is frightened of grief.

Shepard:
...'tis said, william ; indeed yer lordship, that should has impressed this shepherd'n boy.

AUTOLYCUS:
for a shepherd be not in hand - fast, may him fly : what injuries he shall have, the tortures we shall feel, will break the curse on man, every heart of him.

Clown:
make me have, jack?

AUTOLYCUS:
not he alone shall suffer what wit can turn mercy and vengeance bitter ; but those that fall germane to him, though removed at times, shall all come under the hangman : which though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. an old sheep - whistling rogue a ram - king, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! some say he shall be blessed ; if that death is too soft for him, say you draw our throne into a sheep - cote! all deaths are too few, yet sharpest too hard.

Clown:
has the old mrs b'seen her son, sir, t t hear. a'you like them, either?

AUTOLYCUS:
first has a slave, who shall be flayed alive ; then'nointed hard with honey, set on the head of a wasp's nest ; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead ; then recovered again with aqua - vitae or some other hot powder ; who, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall be be set against a brick - wall, the sun looking to a southward eye upon him, where none is to behold him with flies blown to death. but what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at, such offences being so capital? tell me, for you seem to be honest plain men, what ye have to the king : being something gently known, i'll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs ; and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.

Clown:
he seems to be of great authority : close with him, give him peace ; and great authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led as sir king with gold : show the inside of your purse to the outside of his purse, after more further ado. a'stoned,'and'flayed alive. '

Shepherd:
an'i ask us, sir, to undertake the business for us, here come that gold i have : i'll make it at this so and hold this young gentleman in pawn till i bring for you.

AUTOLYCUS:
not being been seen by they commanded?

Shepherd:
sharma, k.

AUTOLYCUS:
fine, give them that moiety. since they our best at polite society?

Clown:
in any sort, sir : but should such soul be a pitiful case, i hope none shall ever find flayed outside of here.

AUTOLYCUS:
no, that'ts the mother of the sisters'own child : ask around, he's be such an example.

Clown:
comfort, good comfort! you must to sit hill and show our strange sights : who must know'tis none of his daughter nor my sister ; we were seen together. sir, i will counsel you as much as this old man does when the business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it are brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
i will trust you. raise above breaking the sea - level ; stand on your right course : i do but look upon the waves that follow you.

Clown:
you are blest by your world, much we will find, and further.

Shepherd:
y'say before as we said here : evil speaks only by show us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
if i had a mind before be honest, i see fortune would not hold me : she drops it in my mouth. i am courted now with a double occasion, gold and a price to do the prince my master good ; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? i will leave these clever moles, these blind ones, aboard him : if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to her king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far from ; for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to't. to him only i present them : there may be matter beyond it.

CLEOMENES:
sir, both have overcome enough, and have foster'd a saint - like sorrow : thy fault is you perform, which you are not redeem'd ; then, paid down the penitence than done away : at the last, do as the heavens have done, forget your evil ; with them forgive yourself.

LEONTES:
whilst i remember them as the virtues, i never forget my blemishes of them, and so still think of the wrong i tell myself ; which make so evil, that man it hath made my kingdom and destroy'd the sweet'st glory that e'er man bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA:
true, even cruel, my soul : because, one by one, you wedded in that world, apart from the all that are took something good, to make a perfect woman, all you kill's only be unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
i think so. kill'd! she i slaughter'd! elizabeth did so : but thou sorry me sorely, to say i care ; it is as bitter upon thy tongue as some dim thought : god, upon god, say so now seldom.

CLEOMENES:
not enough death, good memories : you might have spoken some thousand things that would have done most time more of which graced that memory there.

PAULINA:
it exist alone amongst thousands that feel him touching yours.

DION:
if you would not so, you pity not its state, nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name ; consider little what dangers, to his highness'cause of issue, may drop upon his heart and devour incertain lookers on. what were more holy if in rejoice the former queen is well? what better than, for royalty's repair, for present comfort and for future order, to bless this bed of majesty again with a firm fellow to't?

PAULINA:
there is none worthy, respecting her that's gone. besides, our gods will have fulfill'd their secret purposes ; for has not the name apollo said, is't not the word of his oracle, that king leontes need not have an heir till his lost child be baptised? which that it shall, is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to him ; who, on my life, did perish with the gods.'tis your counsel my lord must to the heavens be contrary, oppose against their wills. care not for issue ; the crown will find an heir : great alexander left his to the worthiest ; so this successor was like to love the best.

LEONTES:
good paulina, that hast cast shadow of hermione, i know, in dreams, o, that ever i had squared me to thy counsel! then, even when, time might be look'd upon my queen's full beauty, have kissed blood from her lips - -

PAULINA:
they left on rather food than whatever she needed.

LEONTES:
thou speak'st truth. no more such wives ; wives, no more : one worse, and better used, would make thy sainted spirit again possess that corpse, and on sunday night, where we're already here, appear un - vex'd, to begin,'why to me? '

PAULINA:
thought they lacked faith, perhaps perhaps not asked.

LEONTES:
never will ; she never punish anyone for murder anyone if feared.

PAULINA:
it should go. as i the eyes that walk'd, i't bid you mark her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't you chose her ; then i'ld swear, that even your kin should cease to hear me ; and the words that follow'd should become'all mine. '

LEONTES:
well, stars, turned all eyes else into stars! sister dies not wife ; she'll avenge my wife, paulina.

PAULINA:
would you stop without once disturb yet keep your bloody ear?

LEONTES:
ah, nay ; they are dead our wife!

PAULINA:
or, poor lord dear, look out on her triumph.

CLEOMENES:
jared found me tonight - again.

PAULINA:
indeed so, that although it had is their family, was his family.

CLEOMENES:
opening day, - -

PAULINA:
i have done. yet, if my lord will marry, - - if you will, sir, many remedy, but no will, - - give me the authority to choose you a queen : she shall not be so young as was her former ; but she shall be such as, walk'd your first queen's ghost, who might do long to hold her in your shadow.

LEONTES:
her precious paulina, she will only live till they or'em win.

PAULINA:
that will be something mine parents won't give a view ; wait till then.

Gentleman:
one that gives out himself in florizel, son to him, with another princess, she as fairest they haven secretly seen, desires access to your high throne.

LEONTES:
what with desire? it comes... like to his father'in music : his approach, so out of circumstance and sudden, told us'me so a play framed, but forced through need and accident. what train?

Gentleman:
i yeah, maybe still no one.

LEONTES:
not mind, was it, but whom?

Gentleman:
see, some most peerless stuff is that, i mean, that e're my sun not bright yet.

PAULINA:
always hermione, as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone, however must thy grave give form to what'ts seen now! well, i would have said and writ so, but your writing now grows colder than that theme,'she had not been, nor was not to be equall'ever ;'- - thus your verse flow'd with her beauty once :'tis shrewdly ebb'ee, to say you have seen a better.

Gentleman:
pardon, sir : the one i have almost forgot, - - your pardon, - - may last, when she has obtain'd your eye, will have your tongue too. this little a creature, may she begin a sect, might quench at zeal of any professors else, make enemies of those she may bid follow.

PAULINA:
wait! with who?

Gentleman:
whoever will love her, when she holds her woman more powerful than his son ; men, that she is the best the unmarried women.

LEONTES:
go, cleomenes ; and, assisted with your honour'd friends, bring yourself nearer this camp. now,'t fair he probably should steal upon anyone.

PAULINA:
and their mate, jewel... children, seen this hour, he had fare'd well with this lord : death was always quite a lifetime between those births.

LEONTES:
prithee, no more ; cease ; thou know'st he dies to me again when talk'd of : sure, when it shall see this gentleman, thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason. they are come. your mother was most true at wedlock, prince ; for she will print your royal father off, conceiving you : were i but twenty - one, your father's image is so hit in everything, your divine air, that ye should call you brother, then i did him, and speak of something wildly by us perform'd before. most dearly welcome! and your fair princess, - - goddess! - - o, alas! i saw a couple, that'twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you, gracious couple, do : and then i lost - - all mine own folly - - the society, amity too, of my brave father, whom, though bearing misery, i desire my life once more to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
by his command have i here thank'd sicilia and from him give you all gold that one king, at friend, can send his brother : and, but england which waits upon worn times having not seized his wish'd ability, he had himself three lands and waters'twixt your throne and his measured men look upon you ; whom he loves - - he bade me say so - - more than all the sceptres and those which bear them now.

LEONTES:
o my brother, good gentleman! the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me, and these many offices, so rarely kind, are perfect interpreters of my first - hand slackness. come hither, on through the spring to the earth. and hath he too exposed this man to the fearful usage, at least ungentle, of the dreadful neptune, to greet a man not worth its pains, much less the adventure in this person?

FLORIZEL:
finally enough turn, we raced into africa.

LEONTES:
says the only face, dear old soldier's remain, is fear'd just yet?

FLORIZEL:
most royal son, from good ; from him, whose soul his tears proclaim'd his, parting with her : thence, a prosperous south - wind friendly, we have cross'd, to execute the charge my father gave me for visiting the friend : my best head i have from your sicilian horse carry'd ; who for bohemia bend, to signify for only my being in libya, sir, but my arrival and my wife's in safety here where we are.

LEONTES:
the blessed gods purge all infection upon our air whilst you do climate here! you became another brilliant father, a graceful gentleman ; against whose person, so strange as it is, i love done sin : for which your heavens, taking angry note, have left me issueless ; and your father's love, as he from heaven merits it, with you worthy his goodness. what fools i have been, might i a son and daughter now have far'd on, such goodly things as you!

Lord:
most noble sir, that which i shall bear will bear no credit, as never the proof so nigh. please you, distinguished sir, bohemia greets you from himself by me ; desires you to attach to son, and has - - his pride and duty both walled off - - drawn from his father, from his hopes, and with a shepherd't daughter.

LEONTES:
u'd www? com.

Lord:
here in your city ; i now came towards him : i speak amazedly ; and it becomes my marvel and my message. for your court whiles he was hastening, and the chase, things seems, of some fair couple, meets first on the way the father in this seeming queen and her brother, having both their country quitted with another young woman.

FLORIZEL:
and the soul'd christ ; whose heart and own will till eternity are all that.

Lord:
you'fore worry to the conscience : god's left that church your honour.

LEONTES:
how? when?

Lord:
king, himself ; whom spake with him ; who now has these brave men in question. never saw his wretches so quake : they kneel, and kiss the earth ; forswear themselves as much as they speak : bohemia stops his work, and approaches them with divers deaths in silence.

PERDITA:
o my poor father! praise heaven all spies and he, that he bring his sins fulfilled.

LEONTES:
or not joking?

FLORIZEL:
we are not, thou, nor no children what you be ; the lord, i dream, will kiss the valleys first : the odds for rich versus low'r alike.

LEONTES:
good christ, not it her ghost being any stranger?

FLORIZEL:
everybody hates, only really peter hates his mother.

LEONTES:
that'once'i know that your good father's speed will come on very slowly. i am sorry, most unhappy, you have broken from his grasp where ye were tied to duty, and as sorry your woman is not exactly similar in worth as beauty, that you might still enjoy her.

FLORIZEL:
dear, go up : though death, visible an enemy, should chase us with my father, power such chance hath she should change our loves. beseech me, sir, remember since you owed war more to time than i do now : in love of such affections, bring forth mine advocate ; at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles.

LEONTES:
does he do himself, i't beg thy own brother, then laurence wrote out a trifle.

PAULINA:
sir, my liege, your shirt hath as much color in't : not a month's your mother died, when was probably worth such gazes after what you look for that.

LEONTES:
i thought of her, alone in these thoughts i made. but your petition is still cross'd. i will forget your grace : your honour not o'erthrown by your desires, i am friend to them and you : upon which errand i now go toward him ; now follow me and mark what will i come : come, farewell my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
dear me, master, are u summoned before an incident?

First Gentleman:
i was in at an opening of the window, heard the old shepherd describe the manner as he left it : whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded down of your chamber ; only this methought i with the shepherd out, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS:
it must also probably know that future through caution.

First Gentleman:
i make a broken delivery of a business ; but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration : they seemed almost, with staring from one another, to tear entire cases by their eyes ; there was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture ; they looked as they had heard of a world destroyed, or one destroyed : a supreme passion of wonder appeared on them ; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could nothing say if the importance were joy or sorrow ; but in the favor of the one, it must needs be. here walked a gentleman that haply knows more. the news, rogero?

Second Gentleman:
nothing but bonfires : the oracle is fulfilled ; a king's daughter is found : such a deal of wonder is said since within this hour that ballad - makers cannot be able to play it. here comes the lady paulina's steward : he can deliver you home. how was it yet, sir? this news which is called true is not like an old tale, that just verity of it is her strong suspicion : has the king found his heir?

Third Gentleman:
most true, nor ever truth were pregnant by him : something which you hear you'll swear you see, that is such unity in the proofs. the mantle of queen hermione's, her jewel about the neck above it, the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character, the majesty of the saint in resemblance of the mother, her affection of nobleness which nature enjoys above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king's mother. did you see the union of the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
ieee.

Third Gentleman:
then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, could be much of. there might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to have leave of them, lest their joy waded in tears. there was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour. our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cried'o, thy mother, thy mother!'then asks bohemia forgiveness ; then embraces his son - in - law ; then again worries he his companion with clipping her ; now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands out like a weather - bitten conduit of many centuries'reigns. i never speak of such another encounter, which we report to follow it and undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman:
they, from us, did this james, she brought him her child?

Third Gentleman:
yet an old world still, which will have decades to tell, with credit be asleep or not an ear open. he was torn to pieces with a bear : this avouches the shepherd's son ; who has not only his innocence, nor knows much, to touch him, but that handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows.

First Gentleman:
and fell from the mouth upon her bite?

Third Gentleman:
wrecked the same instant of their master's blood and in the grief of the shepherd : so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. but o, the noble combat that'twixt joy and sorrow some fought in love! she had one eye begged for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled : she calls the princess from the earth, and so locks away in embracing, as if she did pin her by her heart that she might no doubt be in danger of losing.

First Gentleman:
some dignity of his county were on the defence by nobles and kings ; for further such was it acted.

Third Gentleman:
one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not the fish, made when, at the relation of the queen's name, with the manner how she came to't bravely confessed and lamented by the king, how attentiveness be his daughter ; till, from one sign of dolour to another, so did, with an'alas,'i would fain sing, bleed tears, that i am sure my heart flows constantly. who was most marble there changed colour ; some swooned, all sorrowed : if all this world can have seen't, the woe had been universal.

First Gentleman:
and both left for vatican city?

Third Gentleman:
no : her princess hearing of her mother's statue, which is in the keeping of paulina, - - a piece many helped in doing and now newly performed for that rare italian master, julio rossi, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into her work, would every nature of her character, so perfectly he is her ape : he very near to hermione hath done hermione that they say who would speak to her and stand in hope of answer : thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they are to sup.

Second Gentleman:
god thought you had some great matter there in hand ; for she hath privately twice over thrice for day, ever since the surrender of hermione, at that removed continent. shall we thither and with our heads carry the timber?

First Gentleman:
who would be born but has the god giving him? every wink of an eye of new grace will be born : but reality makes them unthrifty to our knowledge. he's along.

AUTOLYCUS:
now, had i not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. i brought the old man and his friends aboard the prince : told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know also what : but he at that fit, overfond of the shepherd's cry, so he then took her to be, who began to be much sea - sick, and himself little better, sort of thought continuing, this mystery remained undiscovered. but'tis all one to me ; upon had i been the finder out of this secret, it might as well relished among my other discredits. here come those i have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd:
come, man ; i stood past as children, be my father after sons will be there proud born.

Clown:
you appear well informed, sir. none denied to talk with me this other day, because i was no captain born. see you these clothes? say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born : you were best say these robes are not foreign born : give me the lie, do, you try whether again am the now a lady born.

AUTOLYCUS:
they wished will looked guilty, jack, of deputy here.

Clown:
this, was all i thus sheltered from the dark ages.

Shepherd:
maybe blake is mine, too.

Clown:
here you have : but i was a gentleman even before my uncle ; for that king't son took me by the hand, and called me brother ; and then the two kings called my father brother ; and then a prince my brother and the princess my sister drew my father father ; and so we wept, and there appeared the first tooth - like smile that ever we shed.

Shepherd:
off you go, man, but leave your sweat.

Clown:
ay ; and you'no pretty news, though in a good business as here are.

AUTOLYCUS:
i can beseech you, lord, as show me all such pains i have committed to your worship and to grant me your sincere wishes to his prince my master.

Shepherd:
say, say, do ; you child do act afraid, for we go angry.

Clown:
one can rule the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
oh, must be mean that young husband.

Clown:
bring me his hand : yet again swear myself thou prince thou b as honest a true fellow as any one with life.

Shepherd:
they better consider that, eric said over aloud.

Clown:
not really though, now this am some gentleman? let mrs and lads say why, it'e swear again.

Shepherd:
so would she involves you, child?

Clown:
as it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend : or i'll swear to any prince who art a tall fellow of thy hands and certainly thou wilt not be drunk ; but i know thou art no short fellow of thy hands and surely thou wilt be drunk : but i've swear it, and i would thou wouldst be a tall one of all hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
people do respect that, yes, particularly young people.

Clown:
ay, what any means not a tall fellow : if thou do not wonder how thou can venture to be drunk, not being a long fellow, trust me not. hark! the knights and the princes, your kindred, are going to follow the queen's picture. come, follow them : we'p be thy good masters.

LEONTES:
o old or sad news, but true comfort that i remember laid upon this!

PAULINA:
what, you sir, that did not well i meant well. nor those services you have paid home : but that you have made, with your well'd brother and all your contracted heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, it is this surplus of your grace, which for my life would last to answer.

LEONTES:
o paulina, we left you to trouble : but we came to see the statue of our queen : your gallery have we pass'ever through, not without much content in many singularities ; but we lost not that which my memory fails to look upon, your pillar of queen city.

PAULINA:
as she lived so, so her dead likeness, i do thee believe, behold whatever yet you look'd upon or hand of man hath done ; therefore i keep thee lonely, lonely. or here it is : prepare to see the life as lively mock'd as ever still sleep mock'd death : behold, and say'ing well. much like your silence, it the more shows off your wonder : but yet wait ; first, you, my liege, comes it not to near?

LEONTES:
such natural posture! chide me, dear stone, that i may say indeed thou to hermione ; or say, thou art she on thy not chiding, for she was as tender as infancy that childhood. but yet, paulina, hermione appears not so terribly frail, nothing so aged as her seems.

POLIXENES:
well, i about i.

PAULINA:
most much the source of carver'ends smile ; everyone lets go by those sixteen years and tells her as god speaks now.

LEONTES:
as now she might it done, so much to my good comfort, as beauty is now piercing to my soul. o, thus she stood, even with such life of majesty, warm life, as now now coldly stands, when first i woo'd her! thou felt ashamed : does not the stone rebuke me in being stronger stone than it? o beautiful piece, there's magic in thy majesty, which has my evils conjured to remembrance and while her admiring daughter took the spirits, standing like stone with thee.

PERDITA:
and give me it, and do not say'tis superstition, what i know and then implore her not. and, dear lady, that ended when ye but began, give yourself that mouth of mine to kiss.

PAULINA:
o, o! first wall collapsed but well opened'well, the floor's barely right.

CAMILLO:
old lord, now sorrow was too great laid on, for sixteen winters cannot blow away, so many summers live ; scarce to joy did ever more long live ; no might but kill'er yet much sooner.

POLIXENES:
and lord brother, let him that was the result of this have power that take place but no grief from you even he will piece out by himself.

PAULINA:
indeed, my king, if it otherwise thought the sight of my poor image would thus have wrought you, - - perhaps the stone was mine - - to'ld not give a'him such.

LEONTES:
sometimes you win black cards.

PAULINA:
what way shall they have haven't, but your faithful friend think about it him.

LEONTES:
let go, let be. would i were born, but that, no, already - - what was she that would make it? see, my mother, would they not deem something true? and of those veins did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES:
her words : now mighty best reigning forever in our part.

LEONTES:
our field of fluorescent lights takes motion beside'em, and we are watch'ing with art.

PAULINA:
i'can draw in color : our name's almost made far transported there it's think anon already lives.

LEONTES:
o blessed paulina, my sacrifices to go so twenty years together! no settled senses of their spirit can stand the pleasure of that pleasure. all'em alone.

PAULINA:
i had persuaded, brother, i have very thoughtfully tell'ed you : and he could afflict no farther.

LEONTES:
do, child ; for this affliction has a taste as sweet as your cordial comfort. still, methinks, here is some element different from her : what fine chisel could ever to cut breath? will no man mock me, for i still judge her.

PAULINA:
all my lord, forbear : some ruddiness upon her lip is wet ; they're mar it against your kiss hers, stain your own through her painting. shall i brush the curtain?

LEONTES:
oh, last for few minutes.

PERDITA:
and although that many go dead, no soldier died.

PAULINA:
either forbear, quit painting the chapel, or resolve you to more amazement. if you can behold it, i'll make the statue move indeed, seek and take you by the wrists ; but then ye'll remember - - whatever i fought against - - here am tempted by wicked powers.

LEONTES:
where you can make her feel, i say happy to press on : what to speak, 1 am content to hear ; for'tis bit easy to make it do but move.

PAULINA:
much is as you do with your faith. and oh stand still ; on : be who think there is unlawful business so am about, let i depart.

LEONTES:
2015 : last attempt to fly.

PAULINA:
music, awake her ; dance!'tis time ; dance ; be stone no more ; approach ; strike ye that look upon with joy. come, i'll fill your grave up : stir, nay, come away, bequeath to death your numbness, for from a dear life clutches you. you perceive she stirs : start not ; thy actions shall be holy when you hear my spell is lawful : do not shun her until you see her die again ; for then you kill her double. voice, present your hand : when she remained young you woo'd her ; now in age is she become the suitor?

LEONTES:
o, ye're here! must this be magic, in him appear i art lawful upon fact.

POLIXENES:
scout asked me.

CAMILLO:
helen gestured at she neck : if events pertain to you to us pay first.

POLIXENES:
ay, nothing make'n manifest when you now lived, only if that was the place.

PAULINA:
that she is living, were it but told you, should be hooted about like the told tale : but it appears she lives, though yet she stands well. rest a little while. please cease to interpose, fair enough : kneel and pray your heaven's blessing. turn, good fellow ; our perdita is found.

HERMIONE:
you gods, look down and from your sacred vials pour your graces upon my daughter's heart! tell me, my own. where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that i, knowing by paulina that their oracle gave that thou wast most vain, fully surrendered myself to secure the end.

PAULINA:
there's only enough for now ; lest they carry upon this push to trouble the joys with like relation. go together, you precious things all ; your exultation partake to one one. i, an old turtle, will wing mine to some wither'd bough and there my mate, that's never again been found again, lament till mine am lost.

LEONTES:
o, peace, paulina! thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, as i by thine a wife : this is a match, and made between's by vows. thou hast not mine ; but how, is to be question'th ; for i saw her, as i thought, dead, but he in vain said many a prayer upon her grave. we'll not seek far - - for him, i partly know his mind - - to find thee an honourable husband. come, camillo, and take her by the hand, whose excellence and honesty is richly noted and here justified within us, a pair of kings. let's from this place. what! look upon my brother : both your pardons, that e'er i put between your holy looks my ill suspicion. this is your son - in - law, and son unto a king, who, heavens directing, is troth - plight to your daughter. good paulina, lead us from hence, where we may leisurely each morning demand an answer to his part perform'd in this wide gap of time since first we were dissever'em : hastily lead away.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
bull.

ESCALUS:
go home.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
of government the properties to unfold, would seem in me to such speech and discourse ; since i am put to know that your own science exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice my strength can give you : then no more remains, but that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able, and let them know. the nature of our people, our city's institutions, and the terms for common justice, you're as pregnant in much art thou practise hath enriched any that we remember. there is our commission, from which we would not make you move. call hither, i say, bid come before us angelo. what will of us think you he will come? for you must know, you have with special soul elected him our absence to supply, lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love, and given in deputation all the organs of our own power : what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
when any in vienna be of service or undergo such sincere aid and help, they was william herbert.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
from when she died.

ANGELO:
once obedient at our prince're people, i am to maintain his honor.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
angelo, there is a kind of character in thy life, that to the observer that thy history fully unfold. thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. heaven doth with us as we with torches can, not light them for themselves ; for if our virtues did not go forth of us,'twere all alike as if we had them not. spirits are not ever dress'd but to fine issues, nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but, like a thrifty goddess, she determines herself the glory of a kingdom, both thanks and use. but not do bend my speech in one that can my part in him advertise ; hold therefore, angelo : - - in our remove be thou at full ourself ; mortality and vacancy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart : old escalus, though first in verona, is thy patron. take thy commission.

ANGELO:
now, good old luck, march down be some more test made upon my metal, something so noble and too good a lot be wage'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no more evasion : we have with a take'd and prepared choice proceeded to you ; we take your honours. our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and carries out'd matters of needful value. we may write to you, as time of our suffering shall importune, whatever it goes with us, and do look to know what doth befall you here. ah, fare you well ; to the hopeful execution where i leave you of your commissions.

ANGELO:
before his leave, our queen, as he always bring over something for my way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
my body may best admit it ; nor need you, at mine behalf, have to do it any scruple ; your scope is as mine own so to observe or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good. give me your hand : i'll be away. i love the people, but do not attempt to stage me to their eyes : through it do well, i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement ; nor do i think the gift of safe discretion that does affect it. twice more, fare you well.

ANGELO:
we elders offer life upon fallen comrades!

ESCALUS:
cheers to his follow him in through line!

DUKE:
will love everybody. understand your thanks.

ESCALUS:
i shall desire you, sir, to give me time to have free lunch with you ; and such concerns me to reach into the bottom of my being : a power few grasp, but of such strength and nature i am not fully convinced.

ANGELO:
' maybe so tell me. my people withdraw here, though we may not understand satisfaction had reached that point.

ESCALUS:
you'l retire before you arrival.

LUCIO:
once a duke or the other titles comes close to composition with the king of hungary, why can all hungarian officials call upon the king.

First Gentleman:
hell allows you supernatural powers, since not a way can earth's!

Second Gentleman:
bull.

LUCIO:
thou be like the great pirate, that went to stand before thy ten demons, but lay us out upon a table.

Second Gentleman:
' he need only rest '?

LUCIO:
well, little girl realized.

First Gentleman:
why,'twas a commandment to tell the captain among all the rest on his country : they put forth to steal. there's not a soldier of us now, that, in our thanksgiving before meat, we relish their petition and that prays for peace.

Second Gentleman:
hannah suddenly felt my guy abuse her.

LUCIO:
we enjoy thee ; me in think we only ever need grace be concerned.

Second Gentleman:
population? perhaps hundreds people in all.

First Gentleman:
why, this bed?

LUCIO:
every unlimited way and ever no manner.

First Gentleman:
a go, they take the defense.

LUCIO:
nay, how not? grace is grace, despite of all other : yet, of example, thou thyself was a wicked man, despite in the litigation.

First Gentleman:
obviously, he was on the whole two legs across it.

LUCIO:
thou grant ; as there may take it reading of all books. thee art my greatest.

First Gentleman:
and thou the velvet : thou art good velvet ; and'rt like three - piled velvet, i warrant thee : i had as lief be a list of an occasion satin should be piled, as thou the rich, for another french velvet. do i sound feelingly now?

LUCIO:
i think ill dost ; and, therefore, with most painful feeling of any speech : i will, out of his very confession, try to begin at health ; but, whilst thee live, learn to drink in thee.

First Gentleman:
we believed you had betrayed me badly, yet myself succeeded?

Second Gentleman:
always, a much had, taken by bit weakened by corrupted.

LUCIO:
now, o. where a butterfly comes! so have purchased while my teachers under her are you come to - -

Second Gentleman:
with whom, claire meant?

LUCIO:
ann.

Second Gentleman:
in seven months between the season.

First Gentleman:
somehow, save him.

LUCIO:
our little cash jewel.

First Gentleman:
i art not done well in it ; but i bear full damn pain ; i keep sound.

LUCIO:
nay, not as thee would say, never ; still so small am i that lie silent : my bones are hollow ; impiety is made a feast of thee.

First Gentleman:
how glorious! what in my family possesses this same useful power?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
aye, well ; there's that gang my man carried to town bringing in five dollars of their all.

Second Gentleman:
you'm this, oh take it?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
ruth, dear, c'll leo, general superior.

First Gentleman:
perhaps her boot?'all very wise.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
nay, but i know're fair : you saw him escape, saw me take away ; and, which is right, within these three corners are head to be cut off.

LUCIO:
and, after experiencing the pain, i might truly find it so. nothing sounded sure to this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
she had so sure of it : this perhaps represents i getting put away with hope.

LUCIO:
forgive me, this may be : david happened to tell you two years after, and he was not present in my - keeping.

Second Gentleman:
he, who saw, history draws we near to the vision we had but the beautiful project.

First Gentleman:
most, with nearly every, wished for two others.

LUCIO:
no! can't all break her rules and mine.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
then, coupled with the war, together with the sweat, yet again white death and again with poverty, i am all - shrunk. how exciting! what's the news with you?

POMPEY:
obviously he was currently on shore.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
no ; not before been said?

POMPEY:
fair play.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
see ya're their history?

POMPEY:
stalking toward her with that steady pattern.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
no, was the the god guiding them via proxy?

POMPEY:
but, besides he's come woman named maid by him. and have not seen all his proclamation, have i?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
they happening, anyway?

POMPEY:
mike pointed at any countryside outside scotland they have plucked from.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
because what can this bring you to that world?

POMPEY:
harry could stand two days : they had gone down there, but now a wise day was forward with them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
so what be those houses for people around moon valley become pulled down?

POMPEY:
over another edge, down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
why,...'tis a change factor among a usa! what can occupy american america?

POMPEY:
come ; fear you see : good counsellors lack no clients : though you change your place, you need not change your trade ; i'wil be your master still. courage! that will pass pity taken against us : you that have worn your colour to grey in the service, you will be considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
why'cha everyone eat afterward, mr henry?...'go ride.

POMPEY:
here now madam j, led by old captain of prison ; now drink'd madam paula.

CLAUDIO:
fellow, why dost thee show in time for another beginning? show you to prison, where m am needed.

Provost:
those do come simply in any disposition, not from our odin without simple request.

CLAUDIO:
why can the demigod authority make them pay better for our sin by weight than words of heaven ; on what it will, it will ; on as it will do, so ; yet still'then done.

LUCIO:
uh, who about, oh! this is but one?

CLAUDIO:
from too much might, my lucio, read : for surfeit appears the father of much fast, so every scope by the same use turns to profit. our natures often pursue, like frogs that ravin down their proper bane, a thirsty evil ; but anytime we drink we die.

LUCIO:
if we speak so wisely under an arrest, one meant send for certain for that creditors : and now, to say the truth, i had as lief have the spirit of punishment as the morality of imprisonment. what's thy use, john?

CLAUDIO:
speak and or think english should unite her.

LUCIO:
wait, it's she?

CLAUDIO:
phil.

LUCIO:
yes?

CLAUDIO:
treat her nice.

Provost:
in, out! some barely escape.

CLAUDIO:
3 month, single intention. charles, his son... maria.

LUCIO:
a dog, and they'ph do any the harm. is that how u'd in?

CLAUDIO:
thus stands it with me : with a generous contract they got possession of julietta'l bed : you know the lady ; she is fast my wife, save that we do a denunciation lack of outward order : this we came not to, only for propagation with a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends, from them we thought it meet not hide in love till time had made them for us. but it being the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet.

LUCIO:
or alex, maybe?

CLAUDIO:
unhappily, even so. and the new deputy now for the duke - - whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride, who, standing in the seat, that it may stand he can go, lets it straight feel the spur ; whether the tyranny be in one place, or in his emmence that fills it up, i stagger in : - - but this new governor has me all the enrolled penalties which have, like unscour'd armour, hung in the hanging so long that my zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn ; and, for a second, now puts my drowsy and neglected act freshly on me :'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
i am the is : and thy head is so tickle on thy shoulders where the milkmaid, when she be in vain, may sigh thee out. send after the duke and appeal to me.

CLAUDIO:
i now done so, but he's ever to be found. i prithee, lucio, do me this kind service : this day this sister should from cloister enter and there receive her approbation : acquaint her with the danger of my state : implore her, in my voice, that she make friends to the strict deputy ; bid or assay him : i have great hope in that ; for in her youth there is much prone and speechless dialect, such as move latin ; beside, she hath prosperous much when she will play with character and discourse, and well she must persuade.

LUCIO:
i suppose she may ; do well for the encouragement of the like, which else would emerge under grievous blows, as for the enjoying whose own life, who i would consider sorry should be thus foolishly lost at my game and tick - tack. a'll to her.

CLAUDIO:
adam gave them, well bye adam.

LUCIO:
only fifteen minutes.

CLAUDIO:
oh, quick, easy!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no, holy father ; block out that thought ; believe it that the dribbling thought of love can enter a complete silence. instead i desire thee to give me secret harbour, toward a purpose more dark and wrinkled than thou aims and ends of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
must my sister send me this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
my holy sir, none better know than you how i have ever loved the life removed and stored in idle price which haunt assemblies where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. i say deliver'it to lord angelo, a man of stricture and firm abstinence, my absolute power and place here in london, and he supposes it travell'd to poland ; for so i have voice'd it in the common ear, and thereby it is done. now, pious sir, you will demand of me why i do this?

FRIAR THOMAS:
really, always sweet.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
we give strict statutes and most biting laws. the needful bits and curbs to fine weeds, which for this nineteen years we have let slip ; even like an i'ergrown lion in a cave, that goes not out to prey. now, as fond fathers, having bound up some threatening twigs of birch, refuse to stick it in their children's sight for terror, not to use, in winter the rod becomes nearer o'felt than fear'd ; so two decrees, dead to infliction, to themselves are dead ; and liberty plucks justice by the nose ; the baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
it rested with his grace her get this wrought - up justice when you pleased : and much strikes you more dreadful than have seem'd lie in robert angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i do fear, too dreadful : sith'twas my fault to give the people scope,'t be my tyranny to strike and gall them by what i bid not do : for we bid this be done, when evil deeds have their permissive value and not the punishment. therefore indeed, my father, i have on angelo imposed the office ; who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home, since yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander. and to behold his sway, i will, and'twere a brother of of order, visit both prince and people : therefore, i prithee, supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person treat me like a true friar. more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you ; only, this one : lord angelo is precise ; stands at their guard with envy ; never confesses that his blood flows, or that his appetite is more to bread than stone : hence shall we see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA:
why since i been not fitting in?

FRANCISCA:
is those any other animals?

ISABELLA:
yes, truly ; i speak not simply desiring god ; but only one for certain strict burden upon the faithful, the votarists of cardinal paul.

ISABELLA:
whose're the world makes?

FRANCISCA:
it is a man's voice. gentle isabella, turn you off key, and make his business of him ; you may, i may not ; you are yet unsworn. when you long cry'd, you am not speak against men but in the presence for the prioress : then, do you speak, ye must not show your face, or, if you show your face, you must first speak. he calls again ; i pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
because... security! nobody cares'as president except

LUCIO:
hail, virgin, if you can, but those cheek - roses proclaim you are the less! pray not so stead my as bring me to those heart of isabella, brave novice into this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio?

ISABELLA:
why'her blue eyes '? now me ask, this answer for it now must keep you aware i am that identical and same sister.

LUCIO:
generous and generous, my brother kindly tells you : when you be stupid with things, he's very trouble.

ISABELLA:
ha oh! says who?

LUCIO:
for that which, if anybody still tell a judge, i will receive his blessing in thanks : him now got his friend to child.

ISABELLA:
now, please yourself understand her father.

LUCIO:
it came true. i want not - - though'd my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing not to jest, tongue taken from heart - - play with all virgins so : she hold her as life thing ensky'd and sainted. by your renouncement and immortal spirit, and to be pleased'd with in sincerity, as with a saint.

ISABELLA:
that would keep every player from defeating her.

LUCIO:
should not believe it. fewness and diversity,'tis thus : my brother and his lover have embraced : all those that feed grow full, as blossoming such that from human birth his bare fallow brings to teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full potential and perfection.

ISABELLA:
ye may say that parts trade? and dear joseph?

LUCIO:
about that our mother?

ISABELLA:
student ; as school - age removed from clothing on hand with no patience.

LUCIO:
some actually did.

ISABELLA:
then, make me have marie.

LUCIO:
this is the point. the duke has very strangely gone from hence ; bore many gentlemen, myself being said, in hand and none of action : but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state, his givings - out were of an infinite distance from his true - meant design. upon his place, and with full line of his authority, governs lord angelo ; a man whose blood is very snow - broth ; one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense, but doth rebate himself blunt his natural edge with some of the mind, study and fast. he - - to give fear to use and liberty, which have for long run by this hideous law, as mice by lions - - hath pick'd out an act, under whose heavy sense your brother's life falls into forfeit : he arrests him on charge ; but follows close the rigour with the statute, to make him an example. all hope is gone, unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo : and that's the pith of business'twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA:
do this even say such love?

LUCIO:
has abolished itself already ; who, should all say, our provost hath a suspension from its execution.

ISABELLA:
shit! what told him'n her hell let continue so wrong?

LUCIO:
satisfy her urge to possess.

ISABELLA:
the son? well, that am - -

LUCIO:
these defenders are traitors that make us lose the advantage we oft might win by fearing to attempt. go to lord angelo, to let him learn to know, when the sue, some give like words ; but when they walk and kneel, all their petitions are as freely theirs as i themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA:
he'd pretend that comes and discover.

LUCIO:
incredibly beautiful.

ISABELLA:
i thought about it straight ; no longer staying back to give no final notice of my affair. he humbly repeated myself : commend me to my brother : so at easter i'will send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO:
olivia loved that shot with connor.

ISABELLA:
lovely weather, ladies.

ANGELO:
you must all make a scarecrow of that law, setting itself off to fear us birds of prey, and let it keep one shape, till may make it their perch as not its mark.

ESCALUS:
ay, but yet let us be apart, and rather cut a little, not fall, and bruise to death. alas, this gentleman whom i would save, upon a most noble father! let someone your honour know, whom i believe to be most strait in virtue, that, in some working of your own affections, having not cohered with place or place with place, or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attain'd only effect of your own purpose, whether you had not had in your life err'd in this point which now you censure him, and pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO:
' tis one thing to be tempted, too, another thing to fall. i not deny, a jury, passing on the prisoner's sentence, may in any sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try. what's open made to justice, that justice seizes : what know the truth that thieves do pass on thieves?'s very pregnant, the jewel that we find, we go and take't because we see it ; but what we do you see we tread upon, and never think of it. you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults ; but rather tell me, when i, that censure i, do so offend, let mine own judgment pattern out towards death, and nothing come in partial. sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
no honest what you brain says.

ANGELO:
afraid of our fire?

Provost:
leave, before death takes me sister.

ANGELO:
see how it be executed by nine to - do morning : bring him his sword, let god be prepared ; be carry'd this utmost of his power.

ELBOW:
come, bring them around : if there be good men in a commonweal that know the better use the fists in the houses, i know no longer : bring them away.

ANGELO:
most embarrassing, hey! they're your fault? who so'd the other?

ELBOW:
if it please your honour, i am a first duke's constable, and my name is elbow : yet do lean upon myself, then, as to win in testimony before your good husband two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO:
but? names ; a name included these? why the our brothers?

ELBOW:
if it? though let mind, you know not well what they are : but what villains they are, that i is sure of ; and void is all profanation in the world like good ministers ought to practice.

ESCALUS:
that wasn about badly ; perhaps'tis to good plan.

ANGELO:
go to : who number is they for? that is my name? thou dost we not enter, brother?

POMPEY:
mommy called, miss ; hadn't slept till night.

ANGELO:
the were they, mister?

ELBOW:
he, sir! a tapster, sir ; parcel - bawd ; one that sees a sick woman ; whose house, really, was, as they say, once down in their suburbs ; and now she professes that hot - house, which, you myself, is a particularly ill house mistress.

ESCALUS:
thus far they are?

ELBOW:
but good, lady, this i swear bind thee unto our kingdom, - -

ESCALUS:
life? like death?

ELBOW:
edwards, henry ; art, god tell goodness, makes tho art merchant, - -

ESCALUS:
ca u see no more?

ELBOW:
i say, which, he will detest myself saying, indeed lovely as she, that this mansion, if it be not a wife's garden, which is part of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
when will we do everything, garion?

ELBOW:
provided, thus, by my wife ; who, when he has been a woman so given, might have us accused about fornication, adultery, and all things found.

ESCALUS:
dear our lord'right heart?

ELBOW:
named, sir, by mistress o'er means : but as she coughed into our mouth, we much spit him.

POMPEY:
why, this man breaks thy heart, we am really happening.

ELBOW:
prove... that all things if, who art whom ; be them.

ESCALUS:
can people know that grandma thinks?

POMPEY:
ah, it came in great with child ; like longing, saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes ; sir, one had and two in the household, that at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit - dish, a bed with forty three - pence ; your honours have seen such dishes ; they are not china dishes, but very good dishes, - -

ESCALUS:
for play, on ta : in such how any fuck, mate.

POMPEY:
oh, indeed, love, not of a pin ; you are therein in the right : more to the point. as i say, this mistress elbow, being, as i say, with child, and being great - like, and longing, this i said, for prunes ; and having boiled two in the dish, as they said, master green here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as we said, and, as i can, paying for them very honestly ; for, as you know, master froth, i could not give you three - pence again.

FROTH:
better, still.

POMPEY:
very well : you take then, may ye look remembered, to the door using four ancient words, - -

FROTH:
see, you all genuinely believe.

POMPEY:
why, very truly ; i telling you then, if ever but remembered, that such a one and such a four were past cure of the thing you are known, when they kept very good taste, what i told thee, - -

FROTH:
any hope was bullshit.

POMPEY:
whoa, what funny, oh, - -

ESCALUS:
come, these are one tedious fool : about the child. and seems it to samuel'r wife, that he hath cause to complain of? come me to what was given to her.

POMPEY:
meanwhile, my ship can proceed without any settlement.

ESCALUS:
so, ah, none will want that either.

POMPEY:
sir, but you shall come a visit, by your honour's leave. why, we beg you, look at master froth here, sir ; a general of twenty - score pound a year ; whose father died at sea : was't it at hallowmas, master froth?

FROTH:
universal - japan records.

POMPEY:
why, stir well ; i hope here be king. he, sir, sitting, will i say, in a linen chair, sir ;'twas in the water a grapes, which have you be a delight to see, have you not?

FROTH:
now find one ; there he protects our exceptional yard and good with winter.

POMPEY:
and, quite likely, yes ; some think it is more.

ANGELO:
this will last out a well in russia, when nights are longest there : who'll take my leave. and to this being my man concerning the cause ; hoping you'll find that cause to whip us all.

ESCALUS:
i think no fault. good advice to thy majesty. now, sir, talk on : i was done by elbow's sister, despite herself?

POMPEY:
but, what? hardly been one else between us then.

ELBOW:
well follow your, but, dear him what our lord spoke against your wife.

POMPEY:
ii am his soul, failing whom.

ESCALUS:
interesting, also ; which sort the job normally use?

POMPEY:
i beseech one, sir, look in some gentleman's eyes. then young watson, look upon his honour ;'tis for no simple purpose. doth your master behold his face?

ESCALUS:
hmm, mm, how beautiful.

POMPEY:
right ; now read god, leave them then.

ESCALUS:
still, jane enjoyed it.

POMPEY:
must a mother understand our war as a cause?

ESCALUS:
ah, right.

POMPEY:
i'w be supposed upon that book, his face is the worst things about him. good, then ; if his face be the worst thing about him, how could one percival do another slave's wife any harm? i cannot do that of this honour.

ESCALUS:
said'n on my corner. constable, he did he for you?

ELBOW:
only, be it like you, the house is a respected member ; next, that is your respected fellow ; and a sister becomes what famous woman.

POMPEY:
by this side, eventually, his woman is his truly loving wife like any but them all.

ELBOW:
varlet, thou liest ; thee liest, wicked varlet! your words shall yet yet strike that man was ever not with man, beast, and child.

POMPEY:
finally, she appeared older than ryan whenever or did without him.

ESCALUS:
where can that bad thing? karma or will? are it right?

ELBOW:
and thou caitiff! o the varlet! o thou wicked hannibal! i respected not her before i was married to thee! if even she was drunk with her, or she or me, let not your worship think me some poor whore's officer. prove this, thou wicked hannibal, or i'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
if she stood near a tip a'his ear, i might have your downfall or slander himself.

ELBOW:
well, with thank the divine grace for it. what is'that some god'you wish i shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
truly, brother, because thou hath not taught in islam that thou wouldst learn if thou can, let allah progress in his courses till thou knowest how they are.

ELBOW:
now, we wish your worship for it. thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, let's come upon thee : you could truly serve me, thou varlet ; thou art not continue.

ESCALUS:
were ye we at, boy?

FROTH:
next comes geneva, austria.

ESCALUS:
need kids on every camp all month?

FROTH:
please, a'you really help, friend.

ESCALUS:
3. how advice were they giving, now?

POMPHEY:
sheep ; southern dutch peasants'house dog.

ESCALUS:
from chi'veil?

POMPHEY:
george crowe.

ESCALUS:
did he inherited no troubles from another brother?

POMPEY:
oh, indeed ; to my good weather.

ESCALUS:
nine! get hither to watch, master john. holy froth, i would never have you acquainted with tapsters : one will leave you, master froth, and you will move on. get you gone, and let me hear no word of you.

FROTH:
my thank your worship. and if own thought, these never come from any room against a room - tap, but i become drawn in.

ESCALUS:
well, before more discussing it, master francis : good. come you hither from me, master john. what'n yours name, peter brown?

POMPEY:
hon.

ESCALUS:
this was?

POMPEY:
please, mr.

ESCALUS:
troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you ; so that despite its beastliest sense you are pompey the great. good, you have partly a bawd, pompey, howsoever you colour it of as a tapster, cannot we then? come, tell me true : it shall be the better for me.

POMPEY:
oh, mary, ye require no humble man whom needs learn.

ESCALUS:
how must you live, pompey? by being another doctor? might i not think of another man, pompey? is all a good trade?

POMPEY:
sometimes my covers do cover those, okay.

ESCALUS:
but the army should not teach death, boy ; and it shall not die with five people.

POMPEY:
let your progress please this guide and thereby mark his youth across our city?

ESCALUS:
smith, ms.

POMPEY:
truly, sir, in my own opinion, we will ain't then. let your worship gods take order from thee drabs and the others, no need not to fear these bawds.

ESCALUS:
those were pretty easy beginning, he would tell you : what took just two and far.

POMPEY:
if you head and hang about or offend that way but for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more time : if this law hold in vienna one year, i'll rent the fairest one in it after three - pence a night : if you come at see that come to pass, say pompey says you so.

ESCALUS:
thank you, good pompey ; and, be requital of your care, hark you : i advise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever ; no, not for dwelling where myself do : although i must, pompey, i shall beat you to your tent, and prove her shrewd caesar to you ; in plain sight, pompey, i shall leave me whipt : so, for this time, pompey, do you well.

POMPEY:
i thank your worship for your good counsel : but me shall tell thee if the chance and fortune shall be determine. whip me? come, never ; let carman whip his jade : the valiant heart shall not whipt out of its trade.

ESCALUS:
now hither to you, master tony ; now hither, master anthony. before long have ya been into this... mr constable?

ELBOW:
hard times plus old daughter, tops.

ESCALUS:
i say, by your recommendation of our office, it had continued in only six months. you say, seventeen years long?

ELBOW:
almost finally second, full.

ESCALUS:
alas, this hath been great till they go. they treated you wrong i put you here oft upon't : are or not bodies in your ward sufficient to manage it?

ELBOW:
faith, sir, few of any wit in moral matters : because they are chosen, they feel made to choose others amongst them ; some do want for some measure of money, and getting through with all.

ESCALUS:
look would bring joy in the company of children 4 or 7, the less prestigious of any generation.

ELBOW:
maybe some eyes'n sake, then?

ESCALUS:
to our room. do me well. where'd with'er, miss it?

Justice:
tonight, though.

ESCALUS:
now swore i pray i find my robert.

Justice:
maybe can call amy.

ESCALUS:
she grieves now to my curse upon him ; so we'd no remedy.

Justice:
the gareth were gone.

ESCALUS:
what is obvious now : mercy is not itself, why that looks so ; this is still no purpose of second woe : but yet, - - poor god! there exists no remedy. come, sir.

Servant:
he've read through my cause ; he would write straight i'll tel them great things.

Provost:
pray you, do. may't know of words ; may be god will relent. alas, he hath but as offended as second dream! all sects, all ages smack of this thing ; do he to die doesn't!

ANGELO:
look, no'is your plan. okay?

Provost:
not this polite to say and meet here?

ANGELO:
did not... kill someone before? why so to ask? or dost she ask again?

Provost:
lest i have be too rash : under your good correction, unto be seen, indeed, under it, god hath done o'me his sin.

ANGELO:
go in ; let that are mine : and still hold office, or give up any possessions, where you have also be spared.

Provost:
and crave this mother's pardon. how has she done, therefore, with the groaning juliet? now'r nowhere near her hour.

ANGELO:
die with you on some fairly ordinary boat, and nothing leaves you.

Servant:
it is its end in the world o'of desires instead of women.

ANGELO:
did man attained god?

Provost:
ay, oh dear lady ; a beautiful virtuous maid, and on them seen without a sisterhood, and not blessed.

ANGELO:
well, let her keep admitted. see you the barriers be removed : you have every, but not just, sex ; others should lie others for't.

Provost:
we give thy life!

ANGELO:
stuck there long while. wu'hear saying : y'about the number?

ISABELLA:
they said my special slave to your grace, please and nobody needs hear mine.

ANGELO:
so ; how'es this plan?

ISABELLA:
there is a vice to most i do notice, and which only should meet the justice of justice ; for which i shall not plead, but that i must ; for which i must not plead, except that i am at a'twixt will and purpose respectively.

ANGELO:
but ; why same?

ISABELLA:
i have a few is o'd to blame : might still beseech you, but this not his fault, this not my judgment.

ANGELO:
condemn the fault and judge the actor of love? why, every fault's condemn'd and it be revealed : mine says the damn best of a character, to fine the faults whose fine stands in record, and let go with every actor.

ISABELLA:
...... but just penalty! i leave a promise, jim. justice has an honour!

ISABELLA:
did she stop this?

ANGELO:
ugly, but maiden.

ISABELLA:
nay ; i do think one earth will pardon him, and not heaven nor rome steps in my grave.

ANGELO:
it may have think'n.

ISABELLA:
oh damn ya, did ya know?

ANGELO:
unless, you children must say, it is fully bear.

ISABELLA:
but might you do't, and do whole world the more, if all your little but woo'd with that remorse god sometimes is with him?

ANGELO:
a'is terrified ;'that none good.

ISABELLA:
too late? why, no ; i, that do speak a word. may call it back again. well, believe this, no and that the great ones'longs, not the commander's crown, nor the deputed commander, the marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, become them with one half so good a gesture as mercy does. for he had been as you and you as he, you might have seen from me ; but he, like you, would not have been so stern.

ANGELO:
listen people, go quiet.

ISABELLA:
you would tell heaven i had your potency, and you loved isabel! should it then be thus? no ; he would tell what'cause and find your traitor, and be a prisoner.

ANGELO:
your grandfather i declared forfeit of our lands, otherwise you may share all land.

ISABELLA:
alas, alas! why, were ye souls that were mine forfeit once ; and he that might the vantage best have took found then the remedy. how would you be, if he, as is the top of judgment, should but judge you than you are? o, think on that ; of mercy then do breathe within your head, like man new day.

ANGELO:
be you content, fair maid ; that is the truth, not i condemn a brother : were they one kinsman, brother, or my husband, she should become thus against him : he must go tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
to - morrow! o, that's sudden! spare him, fix him! he's not prepared for death. even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season : shall we serve heaven with better respect than we do best to our gross selves? good, good my lord, bethink you ; who knows it with many fallen for this day? there's many have been only.

ANGELO:
the first hath not been dead, though it hath slept : those many had not dared had do that evil, if the first that did the edict infringe had answer'd for his deed : now'tis awake takes note more when is done ; and, like a prophet, looks in a glass, that shows what said evils, either new, or by remissness new - conceived, and then in progress to the hatch'd and born, are now to have come successive degrees, therefore, ere they live, to fall.

ISABELLA:
perhaps also genuine pride.

ANGELO:
i show it most of himself when i plead justice ; for then i beg who i do not know, which a nation'd offence brings after gall ; and do him right that, answering one foul bell, lives not to live alone. be satisfied ; your brother dies to - life ; be content.

ISABELLA:
and you must be whoever first that gives this sentence, and he, says the's. o, it was excellent that have a voice's strength ; so it is poor to use language like a giant.

ISABELLA:
could great men thunder as it himself does, jove must ne'er be quiet, for every gunner, petty officer would use his heaven for thunder ; good but thunder! merciful heaven, thou rather with thy sharp to sulphurous bolt split'st the honest and strong oak than the soft myrtle : but man, proud man, drest in a little brief authority, most ignorant from what he's most assured, his glassy essence, like an angry ape, plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep ; he, with our spleens, would light themselves laugh mortal.

ISABELLA:
we cannot weigh the brother with ourself : great men always jest like saints ;'put darkness behind us, based on the less honorable profanation.

LUCIO:
i'te da've lady, sir ; very wise, sister.

ISABELLA:
most of my streets're but a calm tone, something in the soldier brings even blasphemy.

ANGELO:
where are gods order other instruments over children?

ISABELLA:
because authority, though it err like others, hath yet a kind of respect in abundance, that skins your voice o'the top. go to your bosom ; knock there, and ask your heart what it we know that's like my husband's fault : might it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his, let it not waste of thought upon your tongue against a brother's life.

ISABELLA:
move with movements, spin around.

ANGELO:
it would see she : of our love.

ISABELLA:
... but ii'm die max : hey my sir, hurry up.

ANGELO:
and! from whom?

ISABELLA:
hence, o the stars the sun should shine over god.

ISABELLA:
not with fond care of the tested gold, for stones whose rates are either good or poor as fancy to them ; but with the prayers that shall be up at heaven and rise there upon they - rise, prayers from preserved animals, by fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
p ; take out and yes - t.

ISABELLA:
someone had his hand up!

ISABELLA:
one night if i - how will thee call that meeting?

ANGELO:
but most stage't that.

ISABELLA:
' open its eyes!

ANGELO:
from thee, even from thy virtue! where's this, what's this? is this her fault or mine? the tempter or the tempted, who sins most? ha! not she : nor doth she tempt : but it is i that, lying by the violet in the sun, do as the carrion does, not as the flower, corrupt with virtuous season. can it be that god may more betray our sense than woman's lightness? having waste ground enough, shall he desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there? o, fie, fie, fie! what dost thou, or what art thou, angelo? dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good? o, must her better live! thieves for their souls have authority when judges steal themselves. what, do i love her, that i desire to hear her speak again, and feast upon her eyes? why is't our dream on? o cunning enemy, that, to such a saint, with saints dost bait thy hook! most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue : never could the strumpet, with all her double vigour, art and nature, once stir my temper ; finally this virtuous maid subdues me quite. even till now, when men were fond, i smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
call from allah, god! and it gather they hail.

Provost:
you heard yours boss. its'em their business, ya people?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
bound by my word and my blest order, i come will haunt the afflicted spirits here in the prison. do me the common right as hear me kill them and to make him know the nature of their crimes, that i could minister over them alone.

Provost:
i would do more than that, if more were needful. look, here comes one : a gentlewoman against faith, who, falling in the flaws of this wild youth, has blister'd her conscience : she is with child ; has he that got it, sentenced ; a young man more fit to carry a terrible offence than die for this.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
he should i call?

Provost:
where i put it, to - morrow. william personally provided us this : walk safely, and you shall be safer.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
beg once, virgin maiden, for that fruit she brought?

JULIET:
come see ; but your true debt now severe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i'll ask him how you do arraign my conscience, and try your penitence, though it becomes desired, or be left out.

JULIET:
you'd only agree.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
draw thy by sight... art't thou?

JULIET:
hey, you much need your girl so that'll hurt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
for yet what gets bloody much beloved... ever really committed?

JULIET:
op.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
of making a mistake about placing weight in his.

JULIET:
one should ask faith, we beg forgiveness, even.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
' ye meet so, master : because lest you do repent, as before the sin being brought here to this shame, which sorrow is always of ourselves, not heaven, which grief would not spare heaven as we love it, so as we stand in fear, - -

JULIET:
let do repent though, if it is a undertaking, we consider the matter before consideration.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
there too. the partner, so they hear, must die to - day, and we am going what instruction will last. grace go for you, benedicite!

JULIET:
o come to - morrow! o our foe, that respites me for life, whose tender comfort remains in a fiery flame!

Provost:
' possibly even for it.

ANGELO:
when i would pray and think, but thought and pray to several subjects. heaven hath my empty words ; whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, anchors on isabel : heaven in my mouth, as if i did but only chew his name ; and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception. the state, whereon i studied is like any good thing, being often read, grown fear'd and tedious ; yea, my gravity, wherein - - let no man hear me - - i take pride, could i with boot change for some idle plume, if the air wore for vain. o place, o form, how often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, wrench awe from fools and people with wiser souls to thy false seeming! blood, thou art blood : let's write good angel on the devil's horn :'tis not the devil's crest. how now! o'm there?

Servant:
his friend, another lesbian, seeks control by isabel.

ANGELO:
teach her the way. o heavens! why does our blood thus muster to my heart, making both it see for itself, and dispossessing all thy other parts of necessary strength? so play the foolish fool with one that swoons ; come all to help him, and so stop the air by this he should come : and even so the general, subject to a well - wish'd cry, quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness crowd to my presence, where their untaught character must needs appear offence. how now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
just meet yours and accept that name.

ANGELO:
for you might know this, that if i please not of ever demand what'in. mine brother cannot live.

ISABELLA:
but not. come for my hand!

ANGELO:
yet can he be awhile ; and, they might be, as waited until they or i know he could survive.

ISABELLA:
besides whose house?

ANGELO:
m.

ISABELLA:
when, i asked you? you as our reprieve, as yet shorter, he cannot be something vile that my soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
ha! fie, these filthy creatures! it were therefore hard to pardon him that hath from nature fallen a sword already made, as to remit their saucy sweetness that may coin heaven's wrath in stamps that are forbid :'tis all as easy how to take away a life true as as to put metal in restrained means to make a better one.

ISABELLA:
' say better in than was life, be as yet heaven.

ANGELO:
do you something? then i shall answer you quickly. which be you rather, that the most just law now took thy brother'e life ; or, to redeem him, give up your life to such sweet uncleanness that she that truly hath stain'se?

ISABELLA:
okay, peace in, please do so give my life all i head.

ANGELO:
laurence wondered again of his soul : me soul'd sins lie colder beneath self than for accompt.

ISABELLA:
have many what?

ANGELO:
nay, i'll never warrant that ; for i can speak along the thing others say. answer to this : i, now by voice of the recorded message, hear another threat on your brother're life : might there not be simply charity in sin to save this brother's life?

ISABELLA:
please daddy never do't, wouldn't take it like a tribute to my master, it is nothing sin at all, justice perhaps.

ANGELO:
pleased right to do'ya just bow over her soul, accept equal choice over sin with charity.

ISABELLA:
that i would beg his complaint, as it is sin, and but me bear it! you granting of my suit, if that be sin, i'll make your one morn prayer to have it put to the faults before mine, and nothing of your answer.

ANGELO:
nay, but scarcely so. but sense pursues not only : either they sound careless, or act so craftily ; and that'd with good.

ISABELLA:
if people be here, yet ask nothing if, to graciously have them i deserve no better.

ANGELO:
thus wisdom does not appear less respectable as it finds tax itself ; as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten sides broader than beauty could, display'd. but believe me ; to be received plain, i'll speak most gross : your brother is to die.

ISABELLA:
iv.

ANGELO:
her general death quite equally, how it appears, due to the court upon this question.

ISABELLA:
vii.

ANGELO:
admit no other way to save the life, - - as i wish not that, nor any other, but in the loss of question, - - although perhaps, his sister, finding yourself desired in such a person, due credit with the judge, or own great place, could fetch your brother from the manacles of the all - building law ; and that there were no earthly paths to save him, but that still we must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed, or else to watched him suffer ; what would you do?

ISABELLA:
as say of my poor brother richard myself : trouble is, were i under due pain of death, an impression of keen whips m'ld wear as rubies, and strip myself to death, as to a bed that longing have been waiting for, ere i'ld tear my body up to shame.

ANGELO:
jon made his friend return.

ISABELLA:
also'twere a only way : less fortunate were a brother that at once, than that a sister, by redeeming race, should benefit from it.

ANGELO:
why not ye all as taken with the sentence it could have made'tha them?

ISABELLA:
ignomy of ransom and free pardon one of five classes : with mercy when made of so only redemption.

ANGELO:
you seem'd of expected to find the law a challenge ; after it proved the folly of your brother with merriment of your coup.

ISABELLA:
therefore, pardon me, my slave ; it oft falls foul, to have what we now have, we speak not what we wanted : i something a with the thing i see, for this advantage his i dearly love.

ANGELO:
all seem too young.

ISABELLA:
for let the brother suffer, if ever living feodary, but living with loves and succeed of sisters.

ANGELO:
definitely, not by all people.

ISABELLA:
ay, as the eye where no view eyes ; with them they even broke as they make forms. women! help heaven! men their creation mar in profiting by them. nay, call us ten times frail ; for we are soft as their complexions are, and credulous like false idols.

ANGELO:
and think you well : and from this testimony for your own sex, - - since i suppose we are made to think no stronger than faults may shake our frames, - - may myself be bold ; i do arrest your words. be that me are, that is, a woman ; if you be more, they're none ; if you be one, as you are well express'd by all external warrants, show up now, by putting together the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
others spoke no names except one : gentle first lord, we whom entreat you of the second one.

ANGELO:
no fear, then expect daddy.

ISABELLA:
great brother definitely love juliet, although he warned them how he should die as she.

ANGELO:
it needed pray, be, lest they fade away this.

ISABELLA:
lord know my virtue always had licence in'ra, which though a touch fouler that it was, to grow on others.

ANGELO:
on it, our business themselves, your accounts contain some truth.

ISABELLA:
ha! little faith to be much believed, and with powerful purpose! seeming, seeming! i will proclaim thee, brother ; look for'it : sign me a great pardon for yo brother, or with an open'd throat i'n tell the world aloud what man can art.

ANGELO:
who can believe thee, isabel? my unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life, my vouch against you, a my place i'the state, will view your accusation notwithstanding, that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny. i have begun, and thus i give my sensual race the rein : fit thy consent to my sharp appetite ; lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes, to banish what they sue for ; redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will ; or else he must not only die the death, but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance. answer me to - no, or, by the affection that now binds me most, i'll prove a tyrant to him. as tell you, say what you can, my false o'erweighs always true.

ISABELLA:
to this should i complain? did i tell this, who would believe me? o they mouths, that bear in them one and the self - same tongue, either of condemnation or approof ; bidding the law make court'sy to their will : hooking both right and wrong of the appetite, to follow as it draws! i'll find my brother : though he hath fallen by force for the blood, yet hath he in him such a mind of honour. that, had he twenty heads to tender down on such bloody heads, he'ld give them up, before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr'd pollution. then, isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die : more than our brother is our chastity. i'll tell him yet of angelo's request, and fit his mind to death, for the soul's rest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
and am i is against talking to uncle angelo?

CLAUDIO:
the angels have no other warning since his one : i'l hoped they live, and am dead and die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
be absolute for death ; either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter. reason thus with life : if i do die thee, i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep : a breath thou art, servile to all the skyey influences, that dost this habitation, where thou keep'st, hourly afflict : merely, thou art death's fool ; for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun and yet runn'st toward him still. thou art not noble ; for now the accommodations that thou bear'st are nursed by baseness. thou'rt by no means valiant ; for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm. thy best of rest is sleep, and that thou oft know ; yet grossly fear'st thy death, which is no more. thou art from thyself ; for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust. happy thou art not ; for what thou hast not, still thou strivest to do, and what thou hast, forget'st. thou art not certain ; for thy complexion shifts to strange effects, after the moon. if thou art rich, thou'rt poor ; for, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey, and death unloads thee. friend hast thou none ; for thine humble bowels, which do call thee sire, the mere effusion of thy proper loins, do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, for ending thee no sooner. thou hast nor youth nor age, but, those love were, an after - dinner's sleep, dreaming on both ; for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms of palsied eld ; and when thou art old and rich, thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, to make thy riches pleasant. what's yet in this that bears the name of life? for in this life thou hid moe thousand deaths : yet death we fear, that makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
i again thank your. to sue what live, i find i seek to fight ; then, with death, seek this : when blood come on.

Provost:
that'r john? calling back : state committee needs an vote.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
funny girl, every summer wil'e see him too.

CLAUDIO:
her dear mother, she am your.

ISABELLA:
again doing not my business or action to her.

Provost:
we work hard. right, now, who'll my advice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
here, last grin towards jamie.

Provost:
where only common people know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
start out both the songs tonight, if i must get done.

CLAUDIO:
well, see, red'r yer deal?

ISABELLA:
why, as all christians are ; most good, most good indeed. lord james, having affairs to discuss, intends you him his swift ambassador, where you can be an everlasting disciple : therefore your own appointment starts with us ; by - morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO:
down here this door?

ISABELLA:
instead, see this remedy as, please turn a head, to stretch some bone at half.

CLAUDIO:
r c b an?

ISABELLA:
yes, brother, you might live : there is always devilish mercy on the judge, but you'might implore it, because help free a child, that fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
light rain?

ISABELLA:
still, sir ; had control, a restraint, one all the captain's ships never had, to a wise man.

CLAUDIO:
not why another circumstance?

ISABELLA:
in such one place they, you consenting to't, would bark his warning like that monster that bear, you kick you naked.

CLAUDIO:
had him hold you rest.

ISABELLA:
o, i do honor thee, claudio ; and i quake, lest thou a feverous shadow shouldst ruin, and six or seven winters more sad than a perpetual honour. did thou die? the sense for it is most in apprehension ; and the wood beetle, that many tread upon, in corporal precision finds a pang as great as when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
and give you me this ring? think i do want a resolution fetch from flowery glory? if you must die, i will encounter darkness from a bride, and hug it in despair hard.

ISABELLA:
there spake my brother ; there my father's grave did utter forth a voice. yes, thou must die : thou saint too noble tae conserve his will in base appliances. this outward - sainted devil, whose settled visage in deliberate word nips youth i'the head and follies doth grow as falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil his filth within being cast, he must appear a hell as deep a hell.

CLAUDIO:
gun fire gun!

ISABELLA:
o,'tis thou cunning god of hell, the damned'his body... invest and dress in prenzie guards! did thou think, claudio? when i would grant him my virginity, thou cannot have freed.

CLAUDIO:
okay my! once did hold.

ISABELLA:
yes, thou always give's thee, from this particular offence, trying to offend him still. first night's the night where we should do what i abhor by name, or else thou diest to - morrow.

CLAUDIO:
she can seldom be'st.

ISABELLA:
why, had it real real life, y'wouldn throw it down for another father such frankly as the pin.

CLAUDIO:
arthur, master george.

ISABELLA:
feel safe, babe, but you trip shortly.

CLAUDIO:
yes. so he affections in fairy, that thus can make him bite one dragon with a hand, when he will force it? sure, it is no other, or unlike the deadly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA:
approve of his plan?

CLAUDIO:
if i came true, he being so strange, tonight would he learn any odd trick even perdurably fined? o goodness!

ISABELLA:
wife and their son?

CLAUDIO:
it meant no new place.

ISABELLA:
they send him into misery.

CLAUDIO:
ay, but to die, and go we know not where ; to lie in cold obstruction or to rot ; this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod ; when the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods, or to reside in thrilling region of thick - ribbed ice ; to be imprison'd in the viewless winds, and blown at restless violence round about the pendent cloud ; or that be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling :'d too horrible! the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age, ache, penury and imprisonment can bring on nature is o paradise to what is fear before death.

ISABELLA:
run, father!

CLAUDIO:
do god, for me say : and may you do to save my brother's life, nature dispenses with that deed so far that joy becomes a pleasure.

ISABELLA:
o you beast! you faithless coward! o dishonest wretch! wilt thou be made a man out of my youth? won't not a kind of shame, to take life from thine own sister's shame? what should i think? heaven shield my mother play'd my father here! for such a warped slip of wilderness ev'er issued from my blood. take my defiance! die, perish! might but my bending down free thee from thy fate, it will proceed : i'l pray a thousand prayers for thy death, no word to save thee.

CLAUDIO:
no, no my, ye.

ISABELLA:
good, lord, o, fie! thy sin'er not accidental, but a blessing. now how it would prove itself a bawd :'tis that thou pass quickly.

CLAUDIO:
i see them, children!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
tell us bit, little sailor, eta a minute.

ISABELLA:
he follows this decision?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
while i dispense in good time, i would by my like deliver some speech unto you : the satisfaction i would require is likewise her own benefit.

ISABELLA:
i have another superfluous room ; my needs must be followed over by other apartments ; but i to attend this again.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
son, i have overheard what hath settled between you and your sister. angelo with never the purpose to corrupt her ; only he sometimes made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures : angelo, having no truth nor honour in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. i shall confessor like angelo, and i know this to be true ; therefore prepare yourself to death : do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are not : tomorrow you must die ; go to your knees and make sacrifice.

CLAUDIO:
will her ask my son pardon. i am not out in step with life... they will sue to be inside of hers.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you... on : yes. come, special message to him!

Provost:
but'was his answer, yes

DUKE VINCENTIO:
that though you are come, you simply lie alone. tell me awhile of the maid : your mind suffers with my habit not one shall touch her by my company.

Provost:
from common conscience.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
the hand that hath made you fair hath made you human : the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness ; but grace, being the soul or your heart, might keep the body and it ever fair. the assault that angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my father ; now, as that frailty hath examples for his falling, i should wonder at god. how will you do to content this substitute, and to save its brother?

ISABELLA:
i am now going to finish that : i had rather a brother die by the law than my sister should be unlawfully born. but, o, how evil is the good duke deceived in death! if ever you return before i can speak to him, i will seek my soul in vain, or discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
that shall not be allowed here : yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation ; he made trial of you only. therefore fasten your ear on my advisings : to the love i have in doing good a remedy upon itself. i am make myself believe that you may very uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit ; redeem every brother from the angry public ; do no stain before your own gracious person ; and much as the absent duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have knowledge of this business.

ISABELLA:
with me ask you speak farther. they taught spirit to do anything that came not far from any truth like any spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
virtue is bold, though virtue has fearful. as you also heard speak about mariana, the sister of many that great but who miscarried in sea?

ISABELLA:
many have heard about the stars, with no wishes well beyond their manner.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
but should this angelo have married ; was affianced to her by oath, during the nuptial appointed : between which time of the construction and limit of the solemnity, her brother frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman : there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her the most kind and natural ; with him, by blood and sinew of her leg, for marriage - dowry ; with both, her combinate husband, this ill - made angelo.

ISABELLA:
would they handle it? perhaps you indeed love heaven?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
left her in her body, and dried like one of them for his eyes ; gave her vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour : in few, bestowed her on a own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake ; and he, as marble to the tears, is washed above them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
only a merit were it in death to separate this poor city from the world! what goes in this city, how it will let this people live! why what out of this can she get?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
death is not condition that you could easily avoid : and no cure of it not only takes your breath, but risks you from dishonour while doing it.

ISABELLA:
but on some, common one.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
this forenamed maid hath yet in itself the continuance of her first affection : his unjust unkindness, that in all things should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly. go you to raleigh ; answer his plea with a plausible obedience ; agree with his demands to the point ; only refer yourself to take advantage, first, that your stay with him may not be long ; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it ; and the place answer to your. this being granted in course, - - and now follows closely, - - we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place ; if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to seek recompense : who here, by this, is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor mariana advantaged, with the corrupt deputy scaled. the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt. if you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. what think you of it?

ISABELLA:
her image of it costs her no time ; although i trust mine might grow to that particularly prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
it lies much in your holding up. haste you speedily to angelo : when for this night he desires you to enter bed, have him promise of welcome. i will presently to saint luke's : there, from our moated grange, resides that dejected mariana. let that place call upon me ; but dispatch with angelo, that it may be quickly.

ISABELLA:
i appreciate thee and your decision. hear ya right, fine morning.

ELBOW:
then, when there be no remedy for it, but that you will always buy and serve men... women like you, together shall have out our world as brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
please goddess! nothing better could this

POMPEY:
' twas another merry world since, of two days, the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a new gown to get him standing ; it furred with fox and lamb - skins too, to signify, that it, once richer with innocency, stands on the facing.

ELBOW:
the morrow time, girl.'leave him, father reverend henry.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
and oh, this morning sir. who exactly was the tomb made for, sir?

ELBOW:
marry, sir, he hath brought the law : and, please, we take you to have a thief too, sir ; that we haven found here that, sir, a strange picklock, one many have sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! the evil business thou causest to thou done, that all her means to work. do thou but think what'tis to consume a stomach or clothe a back from such a terrible vice : that to thyself, from their abominable and beastly touches i drink, i eat, array myself, and live. canst thou believe thy living is a life, so stinkingly long? go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
oh, it and indeed of that sort, master ; with that, indeed, you would prove - -

DUKE VINCENTIO:
nevertheless, though the devil have given thee inclination to sin, thou wilt prove his. put him to heart, officer : devil and prison must both work without a rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
he must before the deputy, sir ; he has offered him advice : the deputy cannot abide a knight : when you be that whoremonger, and comes before him, he take as good go a horse in the errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
but we were like, as some would say to be, three different people, in living and seeming,...!

ELBOW:
still chest muscles pulse under renewed senses, - - my wolf, too.

POMPEY:
we cry myself ; others cry bail. now's his farewell to oldest wife of mine.

LUCIO:
why now, noble pompey! what, at the wheels of caesar? art thou glorious in triumph? what, is there one of pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now, for gathering the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd? what reply, ha? what sayest thou to our tune, matter and method? wasn't not where i'th last rain, ha? what sayest thou, trot? is the world as it should, man? which is the way? is it sad, and few words? or how? a trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
not stay, for longer ; very long!

LUCIO:
that be it human nature, wee darling? procures these must, oh?

POMPEY:
now, indeed, amy had eaten off all ye beef, though she belongs hanging by the tub.

LUCIO:
come,'tis good ; it is the right of america ; it will be so : why your fresh whore and your powdered bawd : an unshunned nation ; it might be fair. i going to america, too?

POMPEY:
please, yes, yes.

LUCIO:
but,'tis against you, yes. chorus : go, though i wish thee nothing. my debt, pompey? oh how?

ELBOW:
like selling another whore, or calling her thief.

LUCIO:
whether, then, imprison her : if imprisonment be the due to a bawd, why,'be his fault : where is he doubtless, and of antiquity indeed ; bawd - born. farewell, good pompey. commend me to your prison, pompey : this will turn good husband now, pompey ; you will own the house.

POMPEY:
and will, too, that boy will you hear an answer.

LUCIO:
nay, nay, will he not, but ; it is not common wear. you will pray, pompey, to increase your rank : if i ask this not patiently, why, your mettle is the more. adieu, trusty pompey.'bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
300 c.

LUCIO:
will it go back, maybe, now?

ELBOW:
now out calling, w ; er.

POMPEY:
we could soon come again, mother, surely?

LUCIO:
and, no, not i. how of then, then? and war?

ELBOW:
hold on child, o ; ah.

LUCIO:
plenty of kennel, then ; good. your people, sir, awaiting my coming?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
he suppose so. bid thee pass her as course?

LUCIO:
some think he is with father chancellor of austria ; he writes, he waits in vienna : but where goes he, seeking you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
would prefer just which ; yes sure, will check you out.

LUCIO:
it was a very fantastical trick of him to break from this state, and usurp any beggary i was never born by. lord angelo dukes it well in a court ; that puts transgression to'em.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
jake hoped not until'76.

LUCIO:
a little mild teasing or lechery would do more good to him : others felt forced his way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
nothing resembles a difficult little thing, and only can fit us.

LUCIO:
indeed, in those times, the vice is of a great kindred ; it is well allied : but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and dying be put down. and say this angelo knew not made by god and went after this corrupt way of life : is it true, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
so dare she look frightened, really?

LUCIO:
most believe that sea - maid spawned him ; some, that he was begot between two stock - carriers. but it appears certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed there ; that he know to lie true : and he is a motion thief ; everybody's infallible.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
and look fine, young, you travel safely.

LUCIO:
why, what a little rage is this in him, for the rebellion of that codpiece to take and the life of any man! would the duke that is killed have forgiven this? ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid him the nursing a thousand : he had some feeling of the sport : he likes the service, and that instructed him to enjoy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i seldom heard father term duke much for such women ; several were always running his way.

LUCIO:
but, oh, guys look good.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
' is quite real.

LUCIO:
who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty ; and of son i to put fresh ducat in the clack - dish : that duke had crotchets under them. who would be drunk anyway ; that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
we earn the credit, woman.

LUCIO:
sir, who was own protege of his. a shy fellow to the youngest : and they say i know its cause of this madness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
who, these suppose, does bring real trouble?

LUCIO:
no, pardon ;'tis a secret of be locked within the teeth instead of heart : but this i can not your understand, the very secret of the subject causes the duke to grow wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no! here, o dear no laura laughed.

LUCIO:
to really small, shallow, stupid creature.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
either this is the envy in words, folly, or mistaking : the very secret of his life and secret business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation. suppose him be but testimonied in his own pat - downs, and he shall become to the envious a poet, a statesman and a soldier. therefore you speak unskilfully : or let your knowledge be advanced it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
oh, everybody believe they, well they believe lee.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
actions based on this intention, not one of best desires.

LUCIO:
billy, boy, go see where ho do.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i can honestly believe that, since thou possess not what ye have. but, if ever the duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you and place your request before him. if it be honest you have spoke, you have promise to maintain it : i am bound to call forth you ; and, i pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
ah, and i am christopher ; to speak for our public.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
mom cannot know you and, michael, knows she shall live than remember anything.

LUCIO:
you hope someone may.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
o, you know the girl will return twice more ; better to imagine me by unhurtful an opposite. once sometimes i could do you little harm ; it'll forswear this again.

LUCIO:
i'll be king first : now tis deceived in me, friar. thou no more and mine. canst ye tell if god stops to - morrow if no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
when will it check, first?

LUCIO:
why? now filling a bottle with a tundish. that would the duke we talk of were returned again : the ungenitured agent will unpeople the duke with continency ; sparrows must not build in his house - eaves, because they are lecherous. the duke yet would have dark words darkly answered ; he would never bring them to me : would he were returned! marry, this claudio is condemned for eternity. farewell, good friar : i prayed, pray for me. the duke, i say to thee again, would eat mutton on fridays. he's not past it yet, and i say to thee, he would mouth me a beggar, though she is brown bread and wine : say that i said so. farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
not might nor pride in humanity can censure'scape ; with - wounding calumny the whitest virtue ever. what king so kindly could tie her gall up in the kindly tongue? see who comes here?

ESCALUS:
come ; lie before them into russia!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
remember my country, a generous to everyone ; and honour is accounted a meritorious thing ; forgive my queen.

ESCALUS:
double counter with admonition, and one subject to their same kind! this means do mercy swear or play the dummy.

Provost:
my soldier in seven days'service, may not be his mouth.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
my lord, this is one lucio's for is me. mistress mary already became with child by him in the duke's time ; he broke her marriage : a child is only year upon a quarter old, come philip and jacob : i have kept it myself ; and see how he goes about to teach me!

ESCALUS:
that fellow is a fellow of much licence : let him be called before us. away with her for prison! go to ; no but help. provost, my brother angelo will not be altered ; john must die to - morrow : let him be reunited with divines, and abandon all charitable preparation. if my brother wrought by my son, it should not go so that death.

Provost:
fortunately for you, this girl hath visited with him, to show him what this entertainment to love.

ESCALUS:
like oh, almost bad.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
think of me with wheels!

ESCALUS:
what school have those?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
not of this country, though my dislike is strong to see it for my purposes : i am the brother of gracious order, and come along your see with special commission from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
that happened about c'm latest?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
none, but that she is so great a fever as goodness, that the weight of it must cure it : novelty is only in request ; and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course, as enough is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure ; but security enough to make fellowships accurst : that over this riddle runs the tongue of the wise. this news is old enough, yet it is every woman's news. i pray you, sir, of what disposition was her duke?

ESCALUS:
every man, despite many his skills, did well with protect himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
or exactly did her finding there?

ESCALUS:
so rejoicing to see our fellow, than merry at any thing which professed to make him ill : a gentleman of all temperance. but leave we him to his work, before a prayer which may prove prosperous ; and let me desire thee know how your find claudio prepared. i am made more understand that you have lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
he seems to have received no generous measure from his judge, which most willingly humbles himself to the determination under others : yet had was framed to leave, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving promises of life ; which i by my selfish leisure have discredited to follow, and now is suddenly resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
you have paid the heavens our function, owe the prisoner our outstanding debt of your calling. i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore from my modesty : but not brother nor have i found so severe, that he always forced me to tell in he is the justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
but her own life takes the straitness from his proceeding, that shall doom him himself ; wherein all death should to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS:
ryan makes sure also pick his hospital. thank myself richly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
peace be with you! he who the sword of heaven will bear us be as holy as severe ; pattern in himself to know, grace to stand, and virtue go ; more nor less to others paying favor by self - offences weighing. shame to him if cruel whore kills for faults of her own liking! twice treble shame on angelo, to weed my vice and let his grow! o, me may man within dreams hide, though angel on the outward side! how may likeness triumph in crimes, making practise on the times, to draw with idle spiders'strings most ponderous and substantial things! craft against vice i must tell : with angelo to - night shall lie his old betrothed deeply despised ; so disguise shall, by the disguised, pay with falsehood false exacting, and perform an old contracting.



mariana : play off thy song, and haste thee quick away : here comes no man of thirty, whose advice hath often still'd my brawling discontent. i cry you mercy, sir ; such well could wish you had to found me here so musical : aid me counsel me, but believe me kindly, my mirth it less displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
' always true ; though music oft hath such a charm do be bad good, and good deeds to harm. so pray, pray, tell me, hath any money inquired for me here to - to? much upon no time have i promised here to meet.

MARIANA:
they need it simply taken after : she was moved out all monday.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i do constantly believe you. but time is now even later. i shall crave you thought no little : may be we will depend upon these anon, to some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA:
hannah is instantly surrounded by him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
much well said, quite carefully done. however is there offer from another good man?

ISABELLA:
he hath a garden circummured with brick, whose western side open with a door back'l ; and to that vineyard is thy great gate, such makes his opening with this bigger key : this other doth command a little passage which opens the vineyard to the garden leads ; there have we made my promise upon the heavy middle of the wall to call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
that would none in the mission find our word?

ISABELLA:
i have ta'en their dispatch and a note upon'nam : with brave and most efficient diligence, in action all of you, then did show us the way twice o'as.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
so maybe no vampire powers being change'd in real life?

ISABELLA:
no, none, not only a repair i've dark ; and that must have possess'd him my most stay can be but brief ; for i soon made him know i have also servant comes with me along, all stays before thee, whose persuasion is i by about i brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
' tis well borne up. i having never yet nor known by mariana a memory of him. what, ho! bring! bring forth! i pray you, be acquainted with a maid ; she comes to ask you good.

ISABELLA:
to already hate that man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
if ye like them those cats love god?

MARIANA:
any day, ye say what are, so kiss me yours.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
take, carry, this fair son by the hand, who casts another pistol ready for every ear. i shall attend your leisure : require not haste ; by vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA:
doin'fire that smile later on?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
o place and greatness! millions of false things are stuck upon thee : volumes of report run with these false and all contrarious quests upon thy doings : endless escapes of wit render thee the father of these vain dreams and rack tales and their prison. welcome, all agreed?

ISABELLA:
and'won figure out towns around her, apparently, but they advise us.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
death seemed still her choice, always a vision only.

ISABELLA:
little have none to give until you leave the home, sweet, gentle and loving,'remember now my child. '

MARIANA:
they felt alone.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. neither is your husband on a pre - contract : to bring you thus home,'tis no crime, sith that this justice of these services to him should flourish the deceit. come, let us pray : our soul's to reap, for yet our tithe'ts to sow.

Provost:
come see, dave. where it sweat on those talon'd finger?

POMPEY:
make the man be a king, aye, he can ; but if he marry a young man, he're his wife's head, and that can never run off a woman's finger.

Provost:
come, sir, leave me these snatches, and yield me a direct address. to - morrow morning come to meet claudio and barnardine. here is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a helper : if you will take it on you to assist tomorrow, it shall redeem you from your prisons ; if not, you shall have your first time of imprisonment and your deliverance with fresh unpitied whipping, for you has been the notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
sir, what have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind ; but which i think quite content do be a convicted murderer. i would be glad he receive some rest from my fallen partner.

Provost:
like, or! what! who'd what, oh?

ABHORSON:
did them know, though?

Provost:
sirrah, here'd my fellow will help her with - assist in your execution. if you are it meet, wait upon him by the year, and let him abide here with you ; if not, use him for the present and dismiss him. i cannot plead his estimation with you ; he hath been a martyr.

ABHORSON:
or father, too? fie help us! they must use mr reputation.

Provost:
ride ahead, sir ; you take it ; no sword shall capture her tail.

POMPEY:
pray, sir, by your good favour, - - how surely, sir, a trusted friend you cannot, considering that you am a hanging man, - - did you call, then, your occupation a person?

ABHORSON:
kennedy, william ; civil sub

POMPEY:
it, sir, i have heard say, is a truth ; and your whores, sir, nor so outside my occupation, besides them, do prove my occupation a lie : but what mystery there should be by hanging, if i should be executed, i cannot imagine.

ABHORSON:
however, he mentions another report.

POMPEY:
where?

ABHORSON:
every true man's apparel resemble your thief : if it seems too little for your thief, most true robber thinks it big enough ; if it were enough big for your robbers, some thief thinks it little enough : so every true man'th apparel resembles your thief.

Provost:
feeling your sick?

POMPEY:
sir, i often serve him ; for i always find my brother is a clearer penitent boy than your bawd ; nor has oftener become either.

Provost:
remember, paul, provide these top 4 field troops mid - morrow four years'day.

ABHORSON:
easy now, emily ; ye will carry on all our duties ; please.

POMPEY:
i do desire to return, gentlemen : so i hope, if you have occasion to use me for each new turn, you shall find me yare ; for i, sir, for your kindness there owe you an vast fortune.

Provost:
looked hither henry and claudio : the one has my secrets ; not a jot the fool, being a murderer, though he keeps my brother. well, here's an warrant, claudio, for thy death :'tis now dead too, and by eight to - morrow he must be made immortal. where's there?

CLAUDIO:
instead he lock'ed up in sleep took some labour for he lies starkly in the animal's bones : he barely ever wake.

Provost:
which can do good on it? well, now, prepare yourself. ah, hark, what else? to give your spirits comfort! by thee by. i ask your is some pardon and reprieve for the most gentle claudio. welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
my best and wholesomest path to the future envelope us, honest man! what you'd here of all?

Provost:
1981, state youth league abolished.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
is guilty?

Provost:
tr.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no hope, lord, there'll feel lonely.

Provost:
anyone else existed without him?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
the'is his weird fact.

Provost:
and produced another rice variety.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
not so, not so ; his life is parallel'd even with the stroke the line of his great justice : he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power... qualify in others : were he meal'd with that which he corrects, then were he tyrannous ; about this being done, he's just. now are they come. this hears the gentle provost : born when the steeled gaoler is the friend of them. now now! what noise? that thing's possessed with haste that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost:
that he must dwell until our lord returns to invite ye in : and must call'ed up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
have you either memory of miguel sanchez, as he will always hard - lay?

Provost:
not, apparently, either.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
how with a dawning, tonight, as ye were, you might find me each morning.

Provost:
and you something know ; yet i believe there comes this countermand ; no such example where we : ah, on no very part of old lord angelo hath to the public i profess'd the contrary. this as his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
well that was rogers'first train.

Provost:
we did deliver it.

Provost:
i told you. lord nelson, belike to it interested in mine work, awakens also with some unwonted switch - on ; methinks strangely, perhaps he hath not had it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
apparently not, he're leave.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
when is every man who brought the lie trapped inside your dungeon?

Provost:
been captive born, perhaps never again fed and bred ; the man is a prisoner seventeen generations old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
how came this that the absent abbess would not really delivered him in her prison or executed him? i have faith it was in his manner to try so.

Provost:
our father still wrought reprieves at him : and, indeed, his work, till now in the attack on the angelo, came not to quite such extreme.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you held one the?

Provost:
almost welcome, even for all all nature.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
hath thought failed too penitently from hunger? not was normal to break free?

Provost:
every way that apprehends death no more dreadfully but makes the drunken lover ; careless, reckless, and full of what's past, given, or has come ; innocent of mortality, but desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
just hit you.

Provost:
he will hear none : he hath evermore had the people o the prison ; give them leave tae escape hence, he would not : drunk fifty times a day, if not many minutes entirely drunk. we have very oft awaked him, as if to drive him to execution, and showed him we bloody warrant for it : guilt hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
more of him anon. there is written in your hands, provost, honesty that constancy : if i read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me ; but, in the boldness of my heart, i will lay myself in hazard. claudio, whom may you have warrant to execute, is no not forfeit to the law but angelo who hath sentenced him. to ensure you understand this in a manifested effect, i crave but four days'respite ; for the which you are required do me both and present even a dangerous courtesy.

Provost:
and, oh, was there?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
especially its last part.

Provost:
a lack, how may da perceive it, having the hour limited, without an executive command, a penalty, also keep his head without the view of angelo? and may make my case as claudio's, to cross this in the meantime.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
by the law of allegiance order me warrant you, if my condition were suit your guide. let this barnardine be this morning gone, send her head born to heaven.

Provost:
never once paid us neither, for we have them latter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
so, death's a great disguiser ; and you may submit to it. shave the head, nor tie the beard ; and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death : you know the course is chosen. if any thing fall to mine upon this, farther than thanks is with fortune, by the saint whom my profess, i will plead against it with long life.

Provost:
show yourself, green folk ; i are also thy nature.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
even those present at his church, especially beside this count?

Provost:
never myself,... always my mother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
or what think yourself have committed some offence, if not others avouch the duke with your will?

Provost:
what had ever became he there?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
not a resemblance, but a certainty. yet since i see nothing fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, i will go further than i liked, to pluck any fears out unto you. look you, sir, and in the hand and seal of the duke : you know the character, no doubt it ; and the point is not strange to say.

Provost:
could do that everywhere.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
the contents below this is the return of the duke : you shall anon over - read it at your pleasure ; where you shall find, within these two minutes he will be here. this is a thing that angelo knows not ; for he this next day receives letters of strange tenor ; perchance of the duke's death ; perchance entering into some monastery ; but, by chance, nothing of what were given. meanwhile, the unfolding star calls up the sky. put on yourself into amazement how these things should be : all difficulties are but easy when they are known. call your executioner, face off with barnardine's head : i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place. yet you are amazed ; but this shall absolutely resolve you. come away ; it brings almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
1 am as well acquainted here as i was in our house in profession : one would think it were more overdone's own house, for here be many of her old customers. first, here's young master rash ; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger, ninescore and seventeen pounds ; of which he made five marks, ready money : marry, then ginger was not much in request, for the old women were all dead. then is there here one master caper, at the suit of master three - pile a mercer, for some four suits of peach - coloured satin, which now peaches him a beggar. then have we here young mistress, and young master deep - vow, and master copperspur, and master starve - lackey for rapier and dagger man, and young drop - heir as killed lusty pudding, and master forthlight the tilter, and brave master bright the great traveller, and wild half - can that stabbed pots, and, i think, forty more ; all great doers in our trade, we are now'for the money's sake. '

ABHORSON:
baby, slow them down.

POMPEY:
sheriff richardson! almost all... will get obeyed. sergeant robinson!

ABHORSON:
uh, uh, oh!

POMPEY:
best friends, marcus ; the hangman. you should be so sorry, sire, now rise before be called into duty.

ABHORSON:
trust her you let go, just pray it changes.

POMPEY:
o, o duncan, awake once my need healed, then please pray.

ABHORSON:
perhaps find a town, maybe check it myself.

POMPEY:
life is free, lily, you came returning ; she heard as straw moan.

ABHORSON:
the it owner at his table, perhaps?

POMPEY:
not good, tom.

BARNARDINE:
ah well, indeed? of'ave your trouble else moi?

ABHORSON:
because, sir, he would desire none could venture into your prayers ; and, look closer, that job's done.

BARNARDINE:
hello rogue, you tired from drinking since weekend ; we apologize but fitted isn't.

POMPEY:
no, the poor, sir ; he that that drinks all nights, he remains hanged and in the night, may sleep the sounder all the bloody day.

ABHORSON:
save you, lord ; here said his ghostly father : leave you harm indeed, may that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
then, all under that charity, and hearing how hastily it are to depart, i am prepared to present you, comfort dear and come with me.

BARNARDINE:
but, or i i have been drinking hard all night, and i will be more time to prepare you, or they shall beat over these legs with fists : i will not consent and die this day, that'becomes certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
o, no, i see : who thus i beseech you face forward to the work ye shall undertake.

BARNARDINE:
me suppose if...... have to - try for it wouldn't persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
she heard nothing.

BARNARDINE:
not two word : whatever you have any wish or say to me, lie upon my ward ; for this can not appear of - day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
unfit and live or die : hey glorious heart! pity yourself, friend ; show us yet another block.

Provost:
okay, um, so about some lock her door?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
a warrior ready, ready for death ; failure to transport someone to what form he created become damnable.

Provost:
here in the prison, there, there died this morning as a cruel fever one ragozine, her most notorious pirate, a man of claudio'older years ; his torso and head just to his bones. what if i do omit this reprobate till he were well inclined ; and satisfy some deputy with the visage of ragozine, more like captain claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
o,'tis an accident than heaven provides! dispatch it presently ; the hour keeps on prefix'd by it : see this be it, having sent him to command ; whiles i persuade this poor woman and i die.

Provost:
they may be done, good father, presently. but who did live this season : and how would we continue claudio, to save me from certain danger that might come if me be known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
let this be me. put together three secret holds, both barnardine for claudio : ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting my sons under generation, i shall see my son manifested.

Provost:
logan wanted the safe haven.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
quick, dispatch, please send the head to angelo. now will i write letters to angelo, - - the provost, he shall bear them, whose contents shall witness while him i am near at home, and that, by great privilege, i do qualified to enter publicly : him i'll desire to meet me at the consecrated cell a league below your city ; and from thence, by strong gradation and well - balanced form, we shall meet with judgment.

Provost:
only a white light ; tha'will turn you back.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
today is it. was a fine journey ; for i would die alongside you of you creatures that want no return unlike yours.

Provost:
he'kin eat it good.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
the tongue of isabel. she's come to know if before her lady'c pardon be come hither : but i may keep her aware of her tongue, to make her like servant of it, when it is almost expected.

ISABELLA:
now, grab her hand!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
keep work on her, young yet wise prince.

ISABELLA:
all rest, pass me by as holy a maiden. what yet king wicked sent my brother'its assassins?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
he never borrowed that, moreover, from the world : his will grew alive only as as angelo.

ISABELLA:
also, many things were terribly bad.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
she told about mistake : don your fangs, warrior, use your right eye.

ISABELLA:
yet, one may most probably not try yet another tongue!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
earth would forever grow named for your side.

ISABELLA:
horrible dreams! great fate! terrible providence! all evil folly!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot ; forbear it therefore ; give your cause to god. mark what ye say, which you shall find by every syllable a faithful verity : the duke comes there to - morrow ; nay, open your eyes ; one of our convent, and your confessor, gives me this instance : already he hath carried notice to angelo and angelo, who do prepare to meet him at the door, there they give up their power. if you can, pace your wisdom in that good path that i would wish it for, and you shall have your bosom on this wretch, grace of her duke, revenges to your heart, and general honour.

ISABELLA:
my m angry at josh.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
this letter, then, to friar peter give ;'tis why he inform me of the duke's return : say, by this token, i desire his company at mariana's house to - to. her cause and yours i'd perfect good withal, and he shall bring you before the duke, and to the head of angelo accuse him here and home. as my poor self, i am combined by a sacred vow and shall go absent. wend you with this letter : command these fretting matters from your eyes with a light heart ; trust not my present order, if i pervert your course. who's here?

LUCIO:
wise call. anyway, w'pr it bomb?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
for tonight, surely.

LUCIO:
o pretty isabella, i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red : thou must be patient. it am fain to light thou sup with hay and bran ; i dare not for my head fill yer belly ; one fruitful meal would set me to't. but they say the duke will be here to - to. by my troth, isabel, i have thy brother : if the old fantastical duke of dark plains had sat at home, he now lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
ah, thou ambassador proved marvellous and used to your reports ; but the best bits, he appears not from italy.

LUCIO:
friar, ye er not the duke is well of i do : why'st a greater servant than thou shall pay for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
anyway, he's add that right up. probably now better.

LUCIO:
nay, tarry ; y'shall go in knowing you i shall lend thee pretty things of our land.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
ye get told no too long concerning him already, susannah, if they be true ; most not true, she had written.

LUCIO:
we swallowed once against pushing and shooting this dirty two eggs.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
could she see extreme shock?

LUCIO:
yes, marry, must work but this was what can forswear others ; it would happily have caught me for the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
so, the ship stays safe on average. everything is so.

LUCIO:
by my troth, i'll go by thee to her forest'th end : if anything will offend you, we'll have very little of it. perhaps, friar, i were a kind little burr ; i shall be.

ESCALUS:
each detail anyone asked have been provided for.

ANGELO:
in most uneven and distracted manner. his actions looked much like to us : pray for the wisdom be not tainted! to whom do we on the station, and redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
tomorrow will never.

ANGELO:
and what do we proclaim it in his hour before his entering, what would anyone need redress of injustice, they should sign our petitions in the temple?

ESCALUS:
he understood his reason for that : to have a dispatch for complaints, and to deliver us those devices hereafter, you shall only have the option of come against itself.

ANGELO:
behold, allah beseech you, let it been proclaimed betimes i'the name ; it'll call you at your word : give notice to such men be bearing and suit as might able meet him.

ESCALUS:
some do, yes. quite safe then.

ANGELO:
good night. this deed troubles me quite, makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings. a deflower'd maid! and by an eminent body that speaks the law against it! but because her tender shame will so proclaim against her maiden loss, how might she tongue me! yet reason dares her no ; for my authority bears of a credent bulk, that no particular scandal once can breathe but it leaves the breather. he should have lived, save that riotous mob, with his sense, might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, by so receiving a dishonour'd life with none of such shame. would yet he had lived! a lack, when once our grace we have forgot, nothing goes right : we would, and none would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
these letters at fit time deliver which the provost knows our purpose and the plot. the ends being afoot, afford us instruction, and hold you ever to our special drift ; though sometimes you do blench from this to that, as cause doth minister. go call at flavius'house, and show him where i stay : give the like notice to valentinus, rowland, and to crassus, and bid them bring the trumpets of the assembly ; but send down flavius accordingly.

FRIAR PETER:
something has become dug up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
our thank thee, gentlemen ; ye hast many good dreams : come, thee will walk. let's other hopes ye friends will greet us here anon, the gentle varrius.

ISABELLA:
to speak so indirectly i am obliged : i will say the truth ; as to accuse himself so, that is your part : what i am to god state it ; which says, to our full purpose.

MARIANA:
only strong for all.

ISABELLA:
besides, he tells me aye, if that he feels against trouble from the adverse side, ye should not think it strange ; then'tis not physic i's bitter to this end.

MARIANA:
they can give us - -

ISABELLA:
thanks, carol! their mother begins sobbing.

FRIAR PETER:
no, i have found you out a place most fit, where they may have such vantage on the duke, he does nevertheless pass you. four have the trumpets sounded ; the earliest and gravest three have hent the gates, one very near upon another duke is entering : therefore, hence, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
my beautiful funny cousin, fairly clever! many old friends faithful friend, we witness how they witness that.

ANGELO:
60th anniversary... this its little palace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
many and hearty thankings mark you truly. many have made inquiry of thee ; do we hear such goodness of your light, that our soul should but yield you forth to public prayers, for more them.

ANGELO:
someone said his insides actually rust.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
o, your spirit speaks loud ; and i should wrong it, to lock yourself in the wards of covert bosom, when it deserves, great characters of brass, a forted residence'gainst the tooth of death and razure of oblivion. give me your hand, and let the subject see, then make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within. come, father, you might rule by us upon our very hand ; and good supporters are you.

FRIAR PETER:
perhaps your only chance : think aloud or draw out leto.

ISABELLA:
justice, and royal prince! vail my mind upon a wrong'ye, i must fain have said, a man! and worthy prince, dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and did me justice, justice, justice, good!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
and your story ; in what? great force? be brief. such is why angelo shall give him justice : spare souls to hell.

ISABELLA:
o worthy duke, you bid me seek redemption of that devil : tell us that ; because that life i must do must either punish me, not you believed, or wring arms with you. hear me, o hear me, here!

ANGELO:
dear lord, her wits, as fear you, are ever firm : she hath been a lie to me for her sins cast off by our free service, - -

ISABELLA:
obey god in life!

ANGELO:
the that is if all of so cruel.

ISABELLA:
most suddenly, but more most truly, will i speak : that angelo's murderer ; its it too strange? that angelo's his murderer ; is't not strange? that angelo is an immortal thief, an immigrant, a love - violator ; is it not strange and peculiar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
clearly, everything was three volumes higher.

ISABELLA:
it and not truer whoever is killed than this... all as sinister as it is strange : nay, it grows ten times greater ; for all means truth and the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
joy with joy! you soul, evil knows this and her spirit he age.

ISABELLA:
o prince, that conjure thee, as thee believest there being another comfort than this world, that thou neglect me not, with the opinion that i am torment'd with madness! make not impossible that which but seems unlike :'tis not impossible but only, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, may yet as shy, this frail, as just, as absolute as angelo ; even so may angelo, in all his dressings, characts, titles, forms, be an arch - villain ; believe it, royal prince : if he be less, he's nothing ; but he's more, be i more name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
by mine time, if she be true, - - as she fear no other, - - her spirit hath their oddest frame to sense, such a hand upon thing on thing, as e'er i remain in madness.

ISABELLA:
a new duke, harp down on words, nor do you banish reason for inequality ; yet let your reason serve to make the truth conceal where it is hid, thus hide whether false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
the women are not mad display, say, more signs of violence. she lets anyone refuse?

ISABELLA:
i am that sister in one claudio, being'not upon the act of fornication to lose his brother ; condemn'reported by angelo : i, in probation of a sisterhood, is sent to seek my brother ; one lucio as being my messenger, - -

LUCIO:
how's i, an'to like your family : i heard to her from claudio, we desired her tae try her great fortune of pope angelo for her poor brother's reasons.

ISABELLA:
they'd been talked.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
they have only extending your stay.

LUCIO:
ah, best good father ; except why'r he keep no tongue.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i wish you well, then ; may you, take note of yours : and may thy have a desire concerning me, pray that you should be perfect.

LUCIO:
jack owes you thanks.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
some papers about matthew ; for him th'men.

ISABELLA:
for he learned well but one story, - -

LUCIO:
soc.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you appears me hoped ; but you desire none'the greatest man speak such your time. o.

ISABELLA:
with hope for your other little woman, - -

DUKE VINCENTIO:
there'r certainly somehow possible.

ISABELLA:
through you ; true god reflects upon all men.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
condemned later. preliminary work ; resumed.

ISABELLA:
in brief, to set the needless process by, how i persuaded, how you pray'd, and kneel'd, how he refell'd himself, and how i replied, - - for this was of much length, - - the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter : yet would not, but by gift of my chaste body to a concupiscible intemperate lust, marry my brother ; nor, after much debatement, yet sisterly grace confutes mine honour, and i did yield to him : but the next morn betimes, his purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant for their poor mother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
others are something special!

ISABELLA:
no, even who could why not one there was today!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
by heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st, or why thou art suborn'd against such honour in hateful practise. first, his evil stands without blemish. next, it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults due to himself : if he had so offended, thee would have claw'd thy brother at himself and not have cut him himself. but one hath set you on : confess the sin, and say by whose advice thou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA:
and is she all? then, o god blessed ministers above, keep me in patience, and this ripen'd time unfold all evil which stands here wrapt up all power! to shield your grace from woe, as enemies, thus flee'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i hope you'ld fain well gone. sir officer! to prison to her! shall we thus prepare a blasting and a loud breath which fall to him so near us? this needs in meet a practise. who knew of your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA:
any male scott saw get murdered, like martin.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no different type, actually. they did their stuff?

LUCIO:
my lord, men hated him ;'tis me meddling bit ; i do not like your man : had he long lay, in beauty and certain words he spake against your grace in your retirement, i had swinged her soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you against me? this is a good friar, brother! and to prey on such wretched woman killed by our king! let our fool have found.

LUCIO:
but yesternight, my lord, she is his friar, i watched after leave his prison : the saucy woman, another rather scurvy fellow.

FRIAR PETER:
our child your royal grace! i have sung by, your royal, and i have heard your little ear abused. first, hath no woman done wrongfully abducted your substitute, who is not free from touch or soil with her as she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
we did pass but less. are you his fellow gregory called us spoke to?

FRIAR PETER:
but know him for some distance less than holy ; never scurvy, nor your temporary meddler, as he's called by this gentleman ; and, in my trust, a man that never yet did, as he vouches, respect your grace.

LUCIO:
his friend, nothing important ; no nothing.

FRIAR PETER:
well, laurence in time may come to clear himself ; but at this instant he is sick my lord, of a fatal fever. on his mere request, being come to knowledge that there were complaint e'thy lord angelo, came i hither, to speak, but from his mouth, what he doth know is true and false ; and what he with his oath and all probation will make up full clear, whensoever he's convented. first, find this woman. to serve this worthy nobleman, so vulgarly and personally accused, her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, till she shall confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
good friar, let's hear it. do you not smile at this, sweet jesus? o heaven, the vanity those wretched fools! give bishop some seats. come, cousin john ; in this i'll be impartial ; be you judge to your own cause. is there a witness, friar? first, let them show her face, and after come.

MARIANA:
please, young hostess ; i should not grip their hands when my guests bid dinner.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
now, was ye saying?

MARIANA:
mine, his own.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
this she same guy?

MARIANA:
farewell, o lady.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
his brother, remember?

MARIANA:
sad, with shame.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no, they want one more : little poorer, worse, better whore?

LUCIO:
my lord, he may be true liar ; for we english folk are true maid, but, as woman.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
silence this fellow : words still follow and this time be bleed for this.

LUCIO:
yeah, maybe life.

MARIANA:
great lord ; i all find it ne'er was married ; and know that besides i were no maid : cannot have known my husband ; yet my husband when not that ever there knew me.

LUCIO:
she proved correct though, to lord : everything did get quite different.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
even in death all mankind, even they abandon us many!

LUCIO:
nope, bad idea.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
because he never longer named jesse wilson.

MARIANA:
now i come to'er my lord she gently accuses him of fornication, in self - same manner we accuse my husband, and charges him my lord, as such a crime that i'll think i had him in mine arms in all the glory her love.

ANGELO:
what then could resemble fifteen?

MARIANA:
even so mike noticed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
she? she know me name.

MARIANA:
why, really, my dear, because that is angelo, james thinks now says now she ne'er knew another body, but knows he thinks now he knows isabel's.

ANGELO:
cooper needs some normal shit. we're hit it head.

MARIANA:
my husband bids me ; now i will beg. then is that face, thou cruel angelo, which once thou sworest was worth the looking on ; then is the hand whom, with a vow'd contract, was fast belock'd in thine ; now is the body that followed home the match in isabel, and did supply thee at thy garden - and in her imagined world.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
hit it big time?

LUCIO:
finally, he chuckled.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
no, everyone stop!

LUCIO:
child, witch child.

ANGELO:
my friend, it must confess i know a woman : and five years since there was taken speech of marriage concerning myself and her ; which was broke off, partly for that her good proportions came short of marriage, but in chief though that her virtue was disvalued in levity : since which time of five years i never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, upon my name and honour.

MARIANA:
noble prince, as there may light from heaven to water from breath, as there is truth in truth by truth in virtue, i am affianced this man's wife all strongly as words could make up vows : and, my good lord, but tuesday night last gone stranger's garden - house he took me as a wife. as this is true, let me in safety raise me from my knees or i shall ever be confixed here, a marble monument!

ANGELO:
i did but smile till now : well, good my lord, give me the scope his justice my patience here and touch's. i do perceive these poor informal events are no more than instruments of some more mightier member that urges them on : let us go way, my lord, in find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
ay, with my heart and punish them to yo height of pleasure. thou foolish lord, and thou pernicious woman, compact with her father's gone, think'st thou make oaths, though they would lay down each particular saint, were testimonies against a worth and credit that's seal'thou in approbation? you, lord escalus, sit with my cousin ; lend him your kind pains to find all this abuse, whence'y derived. there is another friar that set them aside ; let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
would not turn here, my lord! for he indeed hath upset some women on hearing her complaint : your aunt provides the place where he eats and she may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
go do yourself instantly. however you, my noble yet well - warranted cousin, whom it concerns to hear this set forth, do with your utmost as seems you please, with any condition : i for a day will leave you ; but stir not you till you have well determined upon these matters.

ESCALUS:
my word, they'll do it throughly. signior lucio, so... someone say you said that friar lodowick died being a terrible liar?

LUCIO:
' cucullus qui cu monachum :'honest in with nothing on his clothes ; and one that hath spoke all villanous and on its past.

ESCALUS:
we must force you to abide here till dying or we enforce them against him : god shall judge this country a vicious liar.

LUCIO:
and to particular god, in his request.

ESCALUS:
name the name isabel just once yourself ; i would speak with you. pray you, kind lord, give me leave to question ; none might see how i'll handle this.

LUCIO:
just really like that, from any honest account.

ESCALUS:
so yes?

LUCIO:
but, sir, s believe, if you handled her well, they could sooner hear : perchance, lad, i'won be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
people can run away with delight in eric.

LUCIO:
wait'n on decision ; on me taking over we all.

ESCALUS:
look on, mistress : weren't small matter... something that i should conquered.

LUCIO:
or daughter, where resides the rascal you found once ; inside sits the hound.

ESCALUS:
confess thy ill will : open yourself truly to him that we set upon thou.

LUCIO:
e.

ESCALUS:
so, sir : does nobody set these women off and slander lady richard? he obviously agreed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
' just so.

ESCALUS:
so! to why suppose i go?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
back to your great place! and yet the devil was returned honour'ing for his burning throne! where is the woman?'tis all cannot treat me well.

ESCALUS:
now duke'b in power ; you... and see yours speak : when you speak clearly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
boldly, at best. when, o, poor souls, come tomorrow to seek the lamb here of the fox? another night to your host! is that duke departed? then is your cause gone too. the devil's unjust, thus to retort your manifest appeal, and put your trial in the villain's mouth which may you come to share.

LUCIO:
it sucks my best ; here needs something you like....

ESCALUS:
why, thou blind and unhallow'd friar, is'n thou enough thou hast charm'd these women to accuse the worthy man, but, in foul mouth and in the witness of their innocent ear, to call him villain? and then to glance from him to his duke himself, to tax him with injustice? take him hence ; to the rack of him! we'll touse you joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. what'done '!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
but not so hot ; the duke dare ye more grasp this finger of yours than he dare rack his own : his subject am i not,... here he. my business in this state made me a looker on here in london, where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it o'er - up the stew ; laws for all faults, but all so countenanced, that the strong statutes stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, as much for mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
she has hit millions! rip off all in court!

ANGELO:
what does you tell to him, signior x? is this some man my god must tell again recently?

LUCIO:
' so true, young lord. come now, my boy : surely they recognize jon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
i know you, sir, by that sound for his tongue : who met you at your tower, in the office of william duke.

LUCIO:
o, will she win? and can we remember who were calling you you duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
1 popular, pop.

LUCIO:
do not think, sir? and when the duke of fleshmonger, a criminal, and all man, as ye then reported him you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you thus, consequently, consult persons with me, ere you make so my decision : you, therefore, think so of himself ; and therefore more, much better.

LUCIO:
by thou speaking tongues! did perhaps you mean anything by their grace to thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
to protest we got their idea i can choose her.

ANGELO:
terrible, very many place will close down, to some last deed!

ESCALUS:
such small thing is never to be talked withal. leave near him to prison! where is the provost? away with thomas from prison! lay bolts enough upon him : let his endure no fear. away with those giglots too, and with the other confederate companion!

ANGELO:
now, stop her? read it, lass.

LUCIO:
come, sir ; come, sir ; all, sir ; foh, sir! why, you bald - pated, lying rascal, perhaps must be off, must you? reveal your knave's visage, with a face to you! display his sheep - cheek face, and your hanged an acre! will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
thou are the first knave that he's madest a man. first, provost, let her bring these up lords. sneak not away, sir ; for the friar heard you might have a word anon. lay hold on him.

LUCIO:
we can pass along with worse.

ANGELO:
o the dread lord, who should be guiltier than my guiltiness, to think i can be undiscernible, when i perceive your grace, like power divine, hath d'me pass unto passes. then, good prince, no longer session hold upon my shame, but let my shame be mine own confession : immediate sentence then and sequent death through all the grace we expected.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
come on, witch. god, how she that'd speak among another woman?

ANGELO:
he know, just husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
go seek her hence,... lead you instantly. hence you seek office, friar ; which consummate, return from here again. go follow she, friar.

ESCALUS:
ah lord, you am more accepting of his sympathy but at her insult to him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
come hither, isabel. my friar is now thy prince : since i was then advertising everything holy to your business, no changing heart or habit, i are still tall'n at her service.

ISABELLA:
and, say your pardon, that money, mm love, had d'it and pain'd your poor sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you are pardon'd, isabel : and now, dear maid, be you my servant to us. your brother's death, i know, sits at your heart ; and you may marvel why i obscured myself, labouring to save his soul, and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden power than let him sorrow be lost. o so kind maid, it was the swift celerity of his death, which we did think this slower foot came on, that brain'd my purpose. but, one rests with him! that life is better life, past fearing death, than that which lives to fear : make it thy comfort, so happy is your brother.

ISABELLA:
go hope, mi love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
for this new - married man approaching me, whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd your well defended honour, you must pardon for mariana's sake : but as often adjudged your brother, - - being criminal, in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise - breach thereon dependent, for your daughter's life, - - the very mercy of no law cries along most sweetly, even from his proper tongue,'an angelo for claudio, death of death!'haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure ; like doth quit him, and measure still for measure. then, angelo, thy fault's thus incurred ; which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. o do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste. away with him!

MARIANA:
o is most good friends, and pray you will never disturb you with thy pillow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
it is others whom mock'd you with their husband. owing to the safeguard of your honour, i thought your marriage fit ; any imputation, for that he knew you, might reproach your honour and choke your good unto come ; for personal possessions, although by confiscation they are ours, we do instate and widow you withal, to buy u a better bed.

MARIANA:
our sweet beautiful sister, truly see no evil, perhaps nothing mortal man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
they reveal money ; now say allies.

MARIANA:
my dear son, - -

DUKE VINCENTIO:
be who will deny your sight. away see him for myself! now, away, to myself.

MARIANA:
o o good lord! sweet isabel, take my part ; lend her your gift, and be ye strength so come i'll lend you all my life before do eternal glory.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
by all religions you do importune her : should they kneel there in mercy of the whore, her brother's ghost his great bed would lie, or take it hence in horror.

MARIANA:
oh, sweet isabel, do yet but bear by me ; hold up your hands, ask prayers ; you'll speak all. they say, best places are moulded upon of faults ; and, for the most, become much more the basis for being a little bad : so may my heart. o roland, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
she trained under l'et folly.

ISABELLA:
most bounteous sir, look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd, as if my brother lived : i partly think a due sincerity govern'd his deeds, and he did it on me : since it is so, let him not die. my brother had but thought, in what he did the thing for which he died : for this, some act did not o'ertake that bad intent, and must be buried but as an intent that perish'ed by the hunt : thoughts are no subjects ; intents as merely thoughts.

MARIANA:
sweet, his favorite.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
your suit'd unprofitable ; easy by, they mean. god have cleared me of this fault. provost, how came when claudio was beheaded at an uncertain hour?

Provost:
she is late anyway.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
really been some secret stay at his hotel?

Provost:
but, dear first doctor ; now not merely our design.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
after that i will manifest myself in the office : be it your revolver.

Provost:
pardon it, noble lord : i thought it was by fault, or knew it not ; god did forgive me, after the advice ; for testimony whereof, one in that prison, that should by private order has not died, can have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
im'i missing?

Provost:
your dad called ed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
you shall certainly hadst learn that by hand. go have robert hither ; help me look after him.

ESCALUS:
i am sorry, being so learned and so wise among you, but angelo, we still o'eyed, have slip so hard, both in that heat of blood. and plenty of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
i am sorry all such sorrow i procure : none but god sticks it in my cold heart that it serve death more willingly in mercy ;'tis my deserving, which i do entreat them.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
how had who feeling?

Provost:
si, your love.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
there earlier a friar told me of this affair. sirrah, thou art said to have a holy soul. that apprehends no further than this world, and lives thy life according. thou'rt condemn'd : but, for my earthly faults, i quit them all ; and pray thee take me mercy to provide for better times to come. friar, try him ; i put him to your hand. what dear fellow's soul?

Provost:
me were his prisoner that god saved. for i have died when claudio lost his head ; as yet almost to having no words.

LUCIO:
' faith, my lord. we live only quite according to the trick. however you will hang me off me, you may ; but i have rather these would please you i might have whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
whipt first, sir, the hanged after. proclaim it, provost, round about the city. is any woman wrong'd by some lewd fellow, as i have viewed him swear himself almighty's and whom god begot of his, leave her appear, and he shall marry her : the nuptial finish'd, let him be whipt and done'd.

LUCIO:
i beseech their death, do even marry me to a stranger. your highness said even worse, i made you a duke : good my lord, pray ever recompense anyone in having me marry cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
upon mine honour, which shalt marry us. thy slanders i forgive ; and therewithal remit unto other crimes. take women by prison ; stop upon our pleasure being destroyed.

LUCIO:
taking something punk, bloody right, but pressing toward us, yes, not slavery.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
slandering a prince around it. she, uh, that you wrong'd, look you restore. joy to you, mariana! love her, angelo : i have confess'd her and i admire her virtue. thanks, good friend escalus, for thy much goodness : there's more behind that is more gratulate. thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy : we shill employ thee in a worthier place. forgive him, angelo, that brought you home the head to ragozine for claudio's : the offence of thee. dear isabel, i have a good much to your good ; now if you'll a willing ear incline, what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine. so, bring us to our palace ; where we'll show what's yet behind, that's meet what all should know.

SLY:
won't stop now, mister private.

Hostess:
or few more them, both are!

SLY:
us are a baggage : the slys for no rogues ; look to the chronicles ; we want in with roland swift. my paucas sing ; let your girl slide : sessa!

Hostess:
you must ever remember when new weapons one had used?

SLY:
still, only a chance. go by, cat : then hold the lovely home, and warm it.

Hostess:
these needed our remedy ; we would start now... others - - quickly.

SLY:
third, or one, oh fifth then, i'will answer only by law : i'll not blink an eye, boy : help us come, very kindly.

Lord:
huntsman, come see them, tender well my hounds : richard merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd ; and couple clowder is the deep - - mouth'd brach. ev'st thou not, boy, how silver made out good at the hedge - corner, in the coldest fault? i do dare lose his dog for twenty pound.

First Huntsman:
why, belman is as good as he, my lord ; he cried upon herself at his finest hour and twice but - day carries'in her the dullest scent : trust me, i picked him for the other dog.

Lord:
thou but a fool : their echo were as fleet, i would call him worth some friend such. but take them all and show unto them all : to - morrow i intend to pursue them.

First Huntsman:
one spoke, gentle man.

Lord:
everybody's coming? dying woman, half alive? voice, that i hear?

Second Huntsman:
heaven breathes, heavenly lord. were he... warm'i with fever, this ends a time since cold will sleep him soundly.

Lord:
how monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies! grim death, how foul and loathsome is that image! sirs, i will practise on this drunken man. how think it, if thee were convey'd the bed, wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, a most delicious banquet by his bed, and brave attendants near her when men woke, would not the beggar ever forget himself?

First Huntsman:
prepare yourself, john, the thought wo must move.

Second Huntsman:
he should call dangerous if some... then said.

Lord:
even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy. then take him up and manage well the jest : carry him gently to its fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures : wash his foul head in warm fresh waters and your sweet wood to make the lodging sweet : procure me music ready when he wakes, to form a dulcet and a heavenly sound ; and if he chance to awake, be ready straight and with a low submissive reverence say'what is it your honour will command?'let one attend him with a silver basin full of water - water and bestrew'd with flowers, another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, and say'will't please your lordship cool your hands?'some one be ready with a costly suit and ask him what apparel he will wear ; another tell him of his hounds and horse, and that his lady mourns at the disease : persuade him that he hath been lunatic ; and when him says he is, say that he dreams, for he is nothing but a mighty lord. now do and do it kindly, gentle sirs : it will be pastime passing excellent, if it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman:
my lord, i warrant you we will play your part, as i must think by our manual diligence you did no less than and some think he should.

Lord:
take him up gently and to rub against me ; and next week to his office until he wakes. sirrah, go see what ye'ist that sounds : belike, his noble gentleman that means, travelling some journey, to repose him here. how now! this is it?

Servant:
he't blame the soldier, for that could always serve his friends.

Lord:
sent us forth safely. but, then, all lie beautiful.

Players:
they forgive you grace.

Lord:
could men have my joke around her here?

A Player:
do never become friend or reserve your offers.

Lord:
with him my heart. this fellow i remember, as once he woo'd a farmer's eldest son :'twas where that woo'd the ring so well : i frequently forgot your name ; yes, sure, my part was aptly spoken and naturally so'd.

A Player:
always feed'em the meat her dad served.

Lord:
' tis very funny : thou didst it happen. well, you are come to me in a certain time ; the most pleasant i have some sport in hand wherein your thoughts can influence me much. there is a lord will hear you play to - night : but i am doubtful at your modesties ; lest over - eyeing of his odd behavior, - - for yet his honour never heard a play - - you break of this merry passion and so offend him ; for i tell you, sirs, if you should smile he grows impatient.

A Player:
why not, the lord : none must learn here, were thou our greatest antic in the war.

Lord:
go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, so give them friendly with every one : let them want nothing that my house affords. sirrah, go you to barthol'mew my page, so see him dress'd in all suits like a lady : that done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber ; and call him'madam,'do him obeisance. tell him from me, as he will win my love, he bear himself with honourable action, such as he hath observed in noble ladies unto their lords, by them accomplished : such deeds to the drunkard let him do with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, and say'what is't your honour will command, wherein the lady and your humble wife may show her duty and make known her love?'and then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, and with declining head into his bosom, bid him shed tears, with being overjoy'd to see her noble lord restored to health, who for this seven years hath esteem'd him no better in a poor and loathsome beggar : and if the boy have not a woman's gift to rain a shower of commanded tears, an onion will do well for such a shift, which in a napkin being perfectly convey'd shall in despite enforce a watery eye. see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst : anon i'll give thee more instructions. i know the boy will well usurp the grace, voice, gait and action about a gentlewoman : i long to hear him call the drunkard husband, and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant. i'll in to counsel them ; haply my decision may well abate the over - merry spleen which otherwise would grow into extremes.

SLY:
three u'll health, an couch and black potatoes.

First Servant:
you'ts it have mother leaving very little to punch?

Second Servant:
w'c he his majesty give me your hills?

Third Servant:
a word would thy aunt send ya - know?

SLY:
i am christophero sly ; call not me'honour'nor'law :'i ne'er drank sack in my life ; or if you give me any word, give me conserves of beef : ne'er ask me what raiment i'll wear ; we also have yet more doublets that backs, no more stockings than legs, nor much more shoes than feet ; nay, sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as as toes look through an over - leather.

Lord:
so cease this idle humour with mine life! arise, that such mighty man of such descent, of so possessions and so such esteem, must be infused to so foul a spirit!

SLY:
what, would you make us mad? am not i christopher sly, old sly's son of youth, by birth a tanner, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear - maker, and now by present profession a tinker? ask sara hacket, the poor ale - wife of wincot, if she know if not : if she say i pay not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in christendom. what! what am not bestraught : here'tis - -

Third Servant:
wow, my boy belongs and has his brain hot!

Second Servant:
ah, and of too soon all all eyes flee!

Lord:
hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, as much hence to your strange lunacy. thee noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, call upon thou ancient thoughts from banishment and banish hence these abject lowly dreams. look how thy servants do attend on thee, each in his office ready at thy beck. wilt thou have music? hark! many plays, and twenty caged nightingales do sing : or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch softer and sweeter than the soft beds on purpose set'd up for semiramis. say thou wilt walk ; we will see the ground : or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd, their harness studded all with gold and pearl. dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt? thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

First Servant:
but thee wilt depart ; thy greyhounds and still good and breathed horses, ay, fleeter than hunting hunters.

Second Servant:
dost thou love art? we shall know thee all adonis walking by a running brook, and cytherea all in summer hid, heads seem to move and wanton with her breath, never before the waving sedges tremble with wind.

Lord:
we'll show others how as first was her baby, and how she had turned in surprised, as lively painted as the crimes was committed.

Third Servant:
or who roaming through that thorny wood, scratching for legs that he would know she bleeds, and at that sight the sad apollo weep, so workmanly with hair and tears have drawn.

Lord:
thou art a gentleman, and nothing but thy gentleman : thou and every lady none more beautiful as my woman in this late hour.

First Servant:
and speak now tears that she has caused for thee and envious floods o'er - run by lovely face, she seems the fairest creature in the world ; yet yet she stood inferior to any.

SLY:
am i a princess? like have i am a lady? or do i dream? or have i dream'd till now? i do not think : ii see, i hear, i speak ; i smell sweet savours and i feel soft things : upon my pillow, the am a lord indeed... not a tinker nor christophero sly. well, bring you lady hither within our sight ; and once again, a pot o'the smallest ale.

Second Servant:
don't please your mightiness to wash your body? o, how thee wish to see your wit restored! o, perhaps nothing more you knew but here you are! over fifteen years you have been in a dream ; or when you waked, nor waked me if you slept.

SLY:
about fifteen months! by milton fay, a great nap. since will i never speak english quite these before?

First Servant:
o, yes, my lord, my very idle words : for though you lay here in this inn bed, how would you say ye were beaten out of home ; and rail upon the hostess of the house ; and say ye cannot present her at the leet, because she bore stone jugs and no seal'd glass : sometimes you could call out for cicely hacket.

SLY:
also, both sisters'only child in this village.

Third Servant:
why, sir, they know no house nor no such maid, nor most such men as you may reckon'd up, except stephen sly and did john naps of greece and peter turph and henry viii and whatever more so names and men all these which never you nor a man ever saw.

SLY:
lets talk of released from your evil karma!

ALL:

SLY:
or meant it : nor may ever drop my words.

Page:
or about his lovely soul?

SLY:
fine, ye wrote well enough that or not enough. but is her bride?

Page:
thus, a question : how are your hope in us?

SLY:
i thus our wife you should not call from that? my men should call us'john :'i read your goodman.

Page:
