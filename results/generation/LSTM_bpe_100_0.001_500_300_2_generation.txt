KING HENRY VI: Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands: Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, That no dissension hinder government: I make you both protectors of this land, While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days, To sin' s rebuke and my C reat or' s praise. WARWICK: What answers Clarence to his sovereign' s will? CLARENCE: That he consents, if Warwick yield consent; For on thy fortune I repose myself. WARWICK: Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content: We' ll yoke together, like a double shadow To Henry' s body, and supply his place; I mean, in bearing weight of government, While he enjoys the honour and his ease. And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor, And all his lands and goods be confis cate. CLARENCE: What else? and that succession be determined.
